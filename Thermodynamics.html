            1 Introduction
            1.1 Intended Audience
            These lecture notes outline a single-semester course intended for upper-division physics majors.

            1.3 Why Study Thermodynamics?
            In a nutshell, thermodynamics is the study of the internal motions of many-body systems. Virtually all physical entities that we encounter in everyday life are many-body systems of some type or
            other (e.g., solids, liquids, gases, and even electromagnetic radiation). Not surprisingly, therefore,
            thermodynamics is a discipline with an exceptionally wide range of applicability. Indeed, thermodynamics is one of the most extensively used subfields of physics outside physics departments.
            Prospective engineers, chemists, and material scientists generally do not study relativity or particle
            physics, but thermodynamics is an integral, and very important, part of their degree courses.
            Many people are drawn to physics because they wish to understand why the world around us is
            like it is. For instance, why the sky is blue, why raindrops are spherical, why we do not fall through
            the floor, et cetera. It turns out that thermodynamics is a very powerful tool for accounting for the
            observed features of the physical world. For example, in this course, we shall explain why heat
            spontaneously flows from hot to cold bodies; why it is impossible to measure a temperature below
            -273◦ centigrade; why there is a maximum theoretical efficiency of a power generation unit that can
            never be exceeded, no matter what the design; why the Earth’s atmosphere becomes thinner and
            colder at higher altitudes; why the Sun appears yellow, whereas colder stars appear red, and hotter
            stars appear bluish-white; and why high mass stars must ultimately collapse to form black-holes.
            1.4 Atomic Theory of Matter
            According to the well-known atomic theory of matter, the familiar objects that make up the world
            around us, such as tables and chairs, are themselves made up of a great many microscopic particles.
            8 1.5. What is Thermodynamics?
            Atomic theory was invented by the ancient Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus,
            who speculated that the world essentially consists of myriads of tiny indivisible particles, which
            they called atoms, from the Greek atomon, meaning “uncuttable.” They speculated, further, that the
            observed properties of everyday materials can be explained either in terms of the different shapes
            of their constituent atoms, or the different motions of these atoms. In some respects, modern atomic
            theory differs substantially from the primitive theory of Leucippus and Democritus. However, the
            central ideas have remained essentially unchanged. In particular, Leucippus and Democritus were
            correct to suppose that the properties of materials depend not only on the nature of their constituent
            atoms or molecules, but also on the relative motions of these particles.
            1.5 What is Thermodynamics?
            In this course, we shall focus almost exclusively on those physical properties of everyday materials
            that are associated with the motions of their constituent atoms or molecules. In particular, we shall
            be concerned with the type of motion that we normally call “heat.” We shall try to establish what
            controls the flow of heat from one body to another when they are brought into thermal contact. We
            shall also attempt to understand the relationship between heat and mechanical work. For instance,
            to what extent does the heat content of a body increase when mechanical work is done on it? More
            importantly, can we extract heat from a given body in order to do useful work on some other body?
            This subject area is called “thermodynamics,” from the Greek roots thermon, meaning “heat,” and
            dunamis, meaning “power.”
            1.6 Need for Statistical Approach
            It is necessary to emphasize, from the very outset, that thermodynamics is a difficult subject. In
            fact, this subject is so difficult that we are forced to adopt a radically different approach to that
            employed in other areas of physics.
            In most areas of physics, we can formulate some exact, or nearly exact, set of equations
            that governed the system under investigation. For instance, Newton’s equations of motion, or
            Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetic fields. We can then analyze the system by solving these
            equations, either exactly or approximately.
            In thermodynamics, we have no problem formulating the governing equations. The motions of
            atoms and molecules are described exactly by the laws of quantum mechanics. In many cases, they
            are also described, to a reasonable approximation, by the much simpler laws of classical mechanics. We shall not be dealing with systems sufficiently energetic for atomic nuclei to be disrupted, so
            we need not consider nuclear forces. Also, in general, the gravitational forces between atoms and
            molecules are completely negligible. This implies that the forces between atoms and molecules are
            predominantly electromagnetic in origin, and are, therefore, very well understood. Thus, we can
            formulate the exact laws of motion for a thermodynamical system, including all of the inter-atomic
            forces. The problem is the sheer complexity of the resulting system of equations. In one mole of a
            substance (e.g., in twelve grams of carbon, or eighteen grams of water) there are Avagadro’s number of atoms or molecules. That is, about NA = 6 × 1023 particles. To solve the system exactly, we
            Introduction 9
            would have to write down approximately 1024 coupled equations of motion, with the same number
            of initial conditions, and then try to integrate the system. This is plainly impossible. It would also
            be complete overkill. We are generally not interested in knowing the position and velocity of every
            particle in the system as a function of time. Instead, we want to know things like the volume of
            the system, the temperature, the pressure, the heat capacity, the coefficient of expansion, et cetera.
            We would certainly be hard put to specify more than about fifty, say, interesting properties of a
            thermodynamic system. In other words, the number of pieces of information that we require to
            characterize the state of the system is absolutely minuscule compared to the number of degrees of
            freedom of the system. That is, the number of pieces of information needed to completely specify
            its internal motion. Moreover, the quantities that we are interested in calculating do not depend on
            the motions of individual particles, or some some small subset of particles, but, instead, depend on
            the average motions of all the particles in the system. In other words, these quantities depend on
            the statistical properties of the atomic or molecular motion.
            The method adopted in thermodynamics is essentially dictated by the enormous complexity
            of thermodynamic systems. We generally start off with some statistical information about the
            motions of the constituent atoms or molecules, such as their average kinetic energy, but possess
            very little information about the motions of individual particles. We then try to deduce some other
            properties of the system from a statistical treatment of the governing equations of motion. In fact,
            our approach has to be statistical in nature, because we lack most of the information required to
            specify the internal state of the system. The best we can do is to provide a few overall constraints,
            such as the average volume and the average energy.
            Thermodynamic systems are ideally suited to a statistical approach, because of the enormous
            numbers of particles that they contain. Statistical arguments actually get more exact as the numbers
            involved get larger. For example, consider an opinion poll published in a newspaper. Such a poll
            usually specifies how many people were interviewed. This number is significant because, even
            if the polling was done without bias, which is extremely unlikely, the laws of statistics say that
            there is a intrinsic error (in the fraction of people who supposedly support a given opinion) of
            order one over the square root of the number of people questioned. It follows that if a thousand
            people were interviewed, which is a typical number, then the error is at least three percent. We
            can easily appreciate that if we do statistics on a thermodynamic system containing 1024 particles
            then we are going to obtain results that are valid to incredible accuracy. In fact, in most situations,
            we can forget that the results are statistical at all, and treat them as exact laws of physics. For
            instance, the familiar equation of state of an ideal gas, P V = ν R T (see Section 6.2), is actually
            a statistical result. In other words, it relates the average pressure, and the average volume, to the
            average temperature. However, for one mole of gas, the relative statistical deviations from average
            values are only about 10 −12, according to the 1/N1/2
            A law. Of course, it is virtually impossible to
            measure the pressure, volume, or temperature of a gas to such accuracy, so it is often convenient
            to forget about the fact that the ideal gas law is a statistical result, and treat it as a law of physics
            interrelating the actual pressure, volume, and temperature of an ideal gas.
            10 1.7. Microscopic and Macroscopic Systems
            1.7 Microscopic and Macroscopic Systems
            It is useful, at this stage, to make a distinction between the different sizes of the systems that we
            are going to examine. We shall call a system microscopic if it is roughly of atomic dimensions, or
            smaller. On the other hand, we shall call a system macroscopic if it is large enough to be visible in
            the ordinary sense. This is a rather inexact definition. The exact definition depends on the number
            of particles in the system, which we shall call N. A system is macroscopic if 1/N1/2  1, which
            means that statistical arguments can be applied to reasonable accuracy. For instance, if we wish
            to keep the relative statistical error below one percent then a macroscopic system would have to
            contain more than about ten thousand particles. Any system containing less than this number of
            particles would be regarded as essentially microscopic, and, hence, statistical arguments could not
            be applied to such a system without unacceptable error.
            1.8 Classical and Statistical Thermodynamics
            In this course, we are going to develop some machinery for interrelating the statistical properties
            of a system containing a very large number of particles, via a statistical treatment of the laws of
            atomic or molecular motion. It turns out that, once we have developed this machinery, we can
            obtain some very general results that do not depend on the exact details of the statistical treatment.
            These results can be described without reference to the underlying statistical nature of the system,
            but their validity depends ultimately on statistical arguments. They take the form of general statements regarding heat and work, and are usually referred to as classical thermodynamics, or just
            thermodynamics, for short. Historically, classical thermodynamics was the first type of thermodynamics to be discovered. In fact, for many years, the laws of classical thermodynamics seemed
            rather mysterious, because their statistical justification had yet to be discovered. The strength of
            classical thermodynamics is its great generality, which comes about because it does not depend on
            any detailed assumptions about the statistical properties of the system under investigation. This
            generality is also the principle weakness of classical thermodynamics. Only a relatively few statements can be made on such general grounds, so many interesting properties of the system remain
            outside the scope of classical thermodynamics.
            If we go beyond classical thermodynamics, and start to investigate the statistical machinery
            that underpins it, then we get all of the results of classical thermodynamics, plus a large number
            of other results that enable the macroscopic parameters of the system to be calculated from a
            knowledge of its microscopic constituents. This approach is known as statistical thermodynamics,
            and is extremely powerful. The only drawback is that the further we delve inside the statistical
            machinery of thermodynamics, the harder it becomes to perform the necessary calculations.
            Note that both classical and statistical thermodynamics are only valid for systems in equilibrium. If the system is not in equilibrium then the problem becomes considerably more difficult.
            In fact, the thermodynamics of non-equilibrium systems, which is generally called irreversible
            thermodynamics, is a graduate-level subject.
            Introduction 11
            1.9 Classical and Quantum Approaches
            We mentioned earlier that the motions (by which we really meant the translational motions) of
            atoms and molecules are described exactly by quantum mechanics, and only approximately by
            classical mechanics. It turns out that the non-translational motions of molecules, such as their
            rotation and vibration, are very poorly described by classical mechanics. So, why bother using
            classical mechanics at all? Unfortunately, quantum mechanics deals with the translational motions of atoms and molecules (via wave mechanics) in a rather awkward manner. The classical
            approach is far more straightforward, and, under most circumstances, yields the same statistical
            results. Hence, throughout the first part of this course, we shall use classical mechanics, as much
            as possible, to describe the translational motion of atoms and molecules, and will reserve quantum
            mechanics for dealing with non-translational motions. However, towards the end of this course, in
            Chapter 8, we shall switch to a purely quantum-mechanical approach.
            12 1.9. Classical and Quantum Approaches
            Probability Theory 13
            2 Probability Theory
            2.1 Introduction
            This chapter is devoted to a brief, and fairly low-level, introduction to a branch of mathematics
            known as probability theory. In fact, we do not need to know very much about probability theory in order to understand statistical thermodynamics, because the probabilistic calculation that
            ultimately underpins the latter subject area is extraordinarily simple.
            2.2 What is Probability?
            What is the scientific definition of probability? Consider an observation made on a general system,
            S . This can result in any one of a number of different possible outcomes. We want to find the
            probability of some general outcome, X. In order to ascribe a probability, we have to consider
            the system as a member of a large set, Σ, of similar systems. Mathematicians call such a group
            an ensemble, which is just the French for “group.” So, let us consider an ensemble, Σ, of similar
            systems, S . The probability of the outcome X is defined as the ratio of the number of systems in
            the ensemble that exhibit this outcome to the total number of systems, in the limit where the latter
            number tends to infinity. We can write this symbolically as
            P(X) = lt Ω(Σ)→∞
            Ω(X)
            Ω(Σ)
            , (2.1)
            where Ω(Σ) is the total number of systems in the ensemble, and Ω(X) the number of systems
            exhibiting the outcome X. We can see that the probability, P(X), must be a number lying between
            0 and 1. The probability is zero if no systems exhibit the outcome X, even when the number of
            systems goes to infinity. This is just another way of saying that the outcome X is impossible. The
            probability is unity if all systems exhibit the outcome X, in the limit that the number of systems
            goes to infinity. This is another way of saying that the outcome X is bound to occur.
            2.3 Combining Probabilities
            Consider two distinct possible outcomes, X and Y, of an observation made on the system S , with
            probabilities of occurrence P(X) and P(Y), respectively. Let us determine the probability of obtaining either the outcome X or the outcome Y, which we shall denote P(X | Y). From the basic
            definition of probability,
            P(X|Y) = lt Ω(Σ)→∞
            Ω(X|Y)
            Ω(Σ) , (2.2)
            where Ω(X | Y) is the number of systems in the ensemble that exhibit either the outcome X or the
            outcome Y. It is clear that
            Ω(X|Y) = Ω(X) + Ω(Y) (2.3)
            14 2.3. Combining Probabilities
            if the outcomes X and Y are mutually exclusive (which must be the case if they are two distinct
            outcomes). Thus,
            P(X|Y) = P(X) + P(Y). (2.4)
            We conclude that the probability of obtaining either the outcome X or the outcome Y is the sum
            of the individual probabilities of X and Y. For instance, with a six-sided die, the probability
            of throwing any particular number (one to six) is 1/6, because all of the possible outcomes are
            considered to be equally likely. It follows, from the previous discussion, that the probability of
            throwing either a one or a two is 1/6 + 1/6, which equals 1/3.
            Let us denote all of the M, say, possible outcomes of an observation made on the system S by
            Xi, where i runs from 1 to M. Let us determine the probability of obtaining any of these outcomes.
            This quantity is clearly unity, from the basic definition of probability, because every one of the
            systems in the ensemble must exhibit one of the possible outcomes. However, this quantity is
            also equal to the sum of the probabilities of all the individual outcomes, by Equation (2.4), so we
            conclude that this sum is equal to unity. Thus,
            
            i=1,M
            P(Xi) = 1, (2.5)
            which is called the normalization condition, and must be satisfied by any complete set of probabilities. This condition is equivalent to the self-evident statement that an observation of a system
            must definitely result in one of its possible outcomes.
            There is another way in which we can combine probabilities. Suppose that we make an observation on a state picked at random from the ensemble, and then pick a second state, completely
            independently, and make another observation. Here, we are assuming that the first observation
            does not influence the second observation in any way. In other words, the two observations are
            statistically independent. Let us determine the probability of obtaining the outcome X in the first
            state and the outcome Y in the second state, which we shall denote P(X ⊗Y). In order to determine
            this probability, we have to form an ensemble of all of the possible pairs of states that we could
            choose from the ensemble, Σ. Let us denote this ensemble Σ ⊗ Σ. It is obvious that the number
            of pairs of states in this new ensemble is just the square of the number of states in the original
            ensemble, so
            Ω(Σ ⊗ Σ) = Ω(Σ) Ω(Σ). (2.6)
            It is also fairly obvious that the number of pairs of states in the ensemble Σ ⊗ Σ that exhibit the
            outcome X in the first state, and Y in the second state, is just the product of the number of states
            that exhibit the outcome X, and the number of states that exhibit the outcome Y, in the original
            ensemble. Hence,
            Ω(X ⊗ Y) = Ω(X) Ω(Y). (2.7)
            It follows from the basic definition of probability that
            P(X ⊗ Y) = lt Ω(Σ)→∞
            Ω(X ⊗ Y)
            Ω(Σ ⊗ Σ) = P(X) P(Y). (2.8)
            Thus, the probability of obtaining the outcomes X and Y in two statistically independent observations is the product of the individual probabilities of X and Y. For instance, the probability of
            throwing a one and then a two on a six-sided die is 1/6 × 1/6, which equals 1/36.
            Probability Theory 15
            2.4 Two-State System
            The simplest non-trivial system that we can investigate using probability theory is one for which
            there are only two possible outcomes. (There would obviously be little point in investigating a
            one-outcome system.) Let us suppose that there are two possible outcomes to an observation made
            on some system, S . Let us denote these outcomes 1 and 2, and let their probabilities of occurrence
            be
            P(1) = p, (2.9)
            P(2) = q. (2.10)
            It follows immediately from the normalization condition, Equation (2.5), that
            p + q = 1, (2.11)
            so q = 1 − p. The best known example of a two-state system is a tossed coin. The two outcomes
            are “heads” and “tails,” each with equal probabilities 1/2. So, p = q = 1/2 for this system.
            Suppose that we make N statistically independent observations of S . Let us determine the
            probability of n1 occurrences of the outcome 1, and N − n1 occurrences of the outcome 2, with no
            regard as to the order of these occurrences. Denote this probability PN(n1). This type of calculation
            crops up very often in probability theory. For instance, we might want to know the probability of
            getting nine “heads” and only one “tails” in an experiment where a coin is tossed ten times, or
            where ten coins are tossed simultaneously.
            Consider a simple case in which there are only three observations. Let us try to evaluate the
            probability of two occurrences of the outcome 1, and one occurrence of the outcome 2. There are
            three different ways of getting this result. We could get the outcome 1 on the first two observations,
            and the outcome 2 on the third. Or, we could get the outcome 2 on the first observation, and the
            outcome 1 on the latter two observations. Or, we could get the outcome 1 on the first and last
            observations, and the outcome 2 on the middle observation. Writing this symbolically, we have
            P3(2) = P(1 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 2|2 ⊗ 1 ⊗ 1|1 ⊗ 2 ⊗ 1). (2.12)
            Here, the symbolic operator ⊗ stands for “and,” whereas the symbolic operator |stands for “or.”
            This symbolic representation is helpful because of the two basic rules for combining probabilities
            that we derived earlier in Equations (2.4) and (2.8):
            P(X|Y) = P(X) + P(Y), (2.13)
            P(X ⊗ Y) = P(X) P(Y). (2.14)
            The straightforward application of these rules gives
            P3(2) = ppq + qpp + pqp = 3 p2 q (2.15)
            for the case under consideration.
            16 2.5. Combinatorial Analysis
            The probability of obtaining n1 occurrences of the outcome 1 in N observations is given by
            PN(n1) = CN
            n1, N−n1 pn1 q N−n1 , (2.16)
            where CN
            n1, N−n1 is the number of ways of arranging two distinct sets of n1 and N − n1 indistinguishable objects. Hopefully, this is, at least, plausible from the previous example. There, the
            probability of getting two occurrences of the outcome 1, and one occurrence of the outcome 2, was
            obtained by writing out all of the possible arrangements of two p s (the probability of outcome 1)
            and one q (the probability of outcome 2), and then adding them all together.
            2.5 Combinatorial Analysis
            The branch of mathematics that studies the number of different ways of arranging things is called
            combinatorial analysis. We need to know how many different ways there are of arranging N
            objects that are made up of two groups of n1 and N − n1 indistinguishable objects. This is a rather
            difficult problem. Let us start off by tackling a slightly easier problem. How many ways are
            there of arranging N distinguishable objects? For instance, suppose that we have six pool balls,
            numbered one through six, and we pot one each into every one of the six pockets of a pool table
            (that is, top-left, top-right, middle-left, middle-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right). How many
            different ways are there of doing this? Let us start with the top-left pocket. We could pot any one
            of the six balls into this pocket, so there are 6 possibilities. For the top-right pocket we only have 5
            possibilities, because we have already potted a ball into the top-left pocket, and it cannot be in two
            pockets simultaneously. So, our 6 original possibilities combined with these 5 new possibilities
            gives 6 × 5 ways of potting two balls into the top two pockets. For the middle-left pocket we have
            4 possibilities, because we have already potted two balls. These possibilities combined with our
            6 × 5 possibilities gives 6 × 5 × 4 ways of potting three balls into three pockets. At this stage, it
            should be clear that the final answer is going to be 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. The factorial of a general
            positive integer, n, is defined
            n! = n (n − 1) (n − 2) ··· 3 · 2 · 1. (2.17)
            So, 1! = 1, and 2! = 2 × 1 = 2, and 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6, and so on. Clearly, the number of ways
            of potting six distinguishable pool balls into six pockets is 6! (which incidentally equals 720).
            Because there is nothing special about pool balls, or the number six, we can safely infer that the
            number of different ways of arranging N distinguishable objects, denoted CN, is given by
            CN = N! . (2.18)
            Suppose that we take the number four ball off the pool table, and replace it by a second number
            five ball. How many different ways are there of potting the balls now? Consider a previous arrangement in which the number five ball was potted into the top-left pocket, and the number four ball
            was potted into the top-right pocket, and then consider a second arrangement that only differs from
            the first because the number four and five balls have been swapped around. These arrangements are
            now indistinguishable, and are therefore counted as a single arrangement, whereas previously they
            Probability Theory 17
            were counted as two separate arrangements. Clearly, the previous arrangements can be divided into
            two groups, containing equal numbers of arrangements, that differ only by the permutation of the
            number four and five balls. Because these balls are now indistinguishable, we conclude that there
            are only half as many different arrangements as there were before. If we take the number three ball
            off the table, and replace it by a third number five ball, then we can split the original arrangements
            into six equal groups of arrangements that differ only by the permutation of the number three, four,
            and five balls. There are six groups because there are 3! = 6 separate permutations of these three
            balls. Because the number three, four, and five balls are now indistinguishable, we conclude that
            there are only 1/6 the number of original arrangements. Generalizing this result, we conclude that
            the number of arrangements of n1 indistinguishable and N − n1 distinguishable objects is
            CN
            n1 = N!
            n1!
            . (2.19)
            We can see that if all the balls on the table are replaced by number five balls then there is only
            N!/N! = 1 possible arrangement. This corresponds, of course, to a number five ball in each
            pocket. A further straightforward generalization tells us that the number of arrangements of two
            groups of n1 and N − n1 indistinguishable objects is
            CN
            n1, N−n1 = N!
            n1! (N − n1)!. (2.20)
            2.6 Binomial Probability Distribution
            It follows from Equations (2.16) and (2.20) that the probability of obtaining n1 occurrences of the
            outcome 1 in N statistically independent observations of a two-state system is
            PN(n1) = N!
            n1! (N − n1)! pn1 q N−n1 . (2.21)
            This probability function is called the binomial probability distribution. The reason for this name
            becomes obvious if we tabulate the probabilities for the first few possible values of N, as is done
            in Table 2.1. Of course, we immediately recognize the expressions appearing in the first four rows
            of this table: they appear in the standard algebraic expansions of (p + q), (p + q) 2, (p + q) 3, and
            (p+q) 4, respectively. In algebra, the expansion of (p+q) N is called the binomial expansion (hence,
            the name given to the probability distribution function), and is written
            (p + q) N ≡
            
            n=0,N
            N!
            n! (N − n)! pn q N−n
            . (2.22)
            Equations (2.21) and (2.22) can be used to establish the normalization condition for the binomial
            distribution function:
            
            n1=0,N
            PN(n1) =
            
            n1=0,N
            N!
            n1! (N − n1)! pn1 q N−n1 ≡ (p + q) N = 1, (2.23)
            because p + q = 1. [See Equation (2.11).]

            2.7 Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation
            What is meant by the mean, or average, of a quantity? Suppose that we wanted to calculate the
            average age of undergraduates at the University of Texas at Austin. We could go to the central
            administration building, and find out how many eighteen year-olds, nineteen year-olds, et cetera,
            were currently enrolled. We would then write something like
            Average Age  N18 × 18 + N19 × 19 + N20 × 20 + ···
            N18 + N19 + N20 ··· , (2.24)
            where N18 is the number of enrolled eighteen year-olds, et cetera. Suppose that we were to pick
            a student at random and then ask “What is the probability of this student being eighteen?” From
            what we have already discussed, this probability is defined
            P18 = N18
            Nstudents
            , (2.25)
            where Nstudents is the total number of enrolled students. We can now see that the average age takes
            the form
            Average Age  P18 × 18 + P19 × 19 + P20 × 20 + ··· . (2.26)
            There is nothing special about the age distribution of students at UT Austin. So, for a general
            variable u, which can take on any one of M possible values, u1, u2, ··· , uM, with corresponding
            probabilities P(u1), P(u2), ··· , P(uM), the mean, or average, value of u, which is denoted ¯u, is
            defined as
            u¯ ≡
            
            i=1,M
            P(ui) ui. (2.27)
            Suppose that f(u) is some function of u. For each of the M possible values of u, there is a
            corresponding value of f(u) that occurs with the same probability. Thus, f(u1) corresponds to u1,
            and occurs with the probability P(u1), and so on. It follows from our previous definition that the
            mean value of f(u) is given by
            f(u) ≡
            
            i=1,M
            P(ui) f(ui). (2.28)
            Suppose that f(u) and g(u) are two general functions of u. It follows that
            f(u) + g(u) =
            
            i=1,M
            P(ui) [f(ui) + g(ui)] =
            
            i=1,M
            P(ui) f(ui) +
            
            i=1,M
            P(ui) g(ui), (2.29)
            Probability Theory 19
            so that
            f(u) + g(u) = f(u) + g(u). (2.30)
            Finally, if c is a general constant then it is clear that
            c f(u) = c f(u). (2.31)
            We now know how to define the mean value of the general variable u. But, how can we
            characterize the scatter around the mean value? We could investigate the deviation of u from its
            mean value, ¯u, which is denoted
            ∆u ≡ u − u¯. (2.32)
            In fact, this is not a particularly interesting quantity, because its average is obviously zero:
            ∆u = (u − u¯) = u¯ − u¯ = 0. (2.33)
            This is another way of saying that the average deviation from the mean vanishes. A more interesting quantity is the square of the deviation. The average value of this quantity,
            (∆u) 2 =
            
            i=1,M
            P(ui) (ui − u¯) 2
            , (2.34)
            is usually called the variance. The variance is clearly a positive number, unless there is no scatter
            at all in the distribution, so that all possible values of u correspond to the mean value, ¯u, in which
            case it is zero. The following general relation is often useful
            (u − u¯) 2 = (u2 − 2 u u¯ + u¯ 2) = u2 − 2 ¯u u¯ + u¯ 2
            , (2.35)
            giving
            (∆u) 2 = u2 − u¯ 2
            . (2.36)
            The variance of u is proportional to the square of the scatter of u around its mean value. A more
            useful measure of the scatter is given by the square root of the variance,
            ∆∗
            u =
            
            (∆u) 2
            1/2
            , (2.37)
            which is usually called the standard deviation of u. The standard deviation is essentially the width
            of the range over which u is distributed around its mean value, ¯u.
            2.8 Application to Binomial Probability Distribution
            Let us now apply what we have just learned about the mean, variance, and standard deviation of
            a general probability distribution function to the specific case of the binomial probability distribution. Recall, from Section 2.6, that if a simple system has just two possible outcomes, denoted 1
            20 2.8. Application to Binomial Probability Distribution
            and 2, with respective probabilities p and q = 1−p, then the probability of obtaining n1 occurrences
            of outcome 1 in N observations is
            PN(n1) = N!
            n1! (N − n1)! pn1 q N−n1 . (2.38)
            Thus, making use of Equation (2.27), the mean number of occurrences of outcome 1 in N observations is given by
            n1 =
            
            n1=0,N
            PN(n1) n1 =
            
            n1=0,N
            N!
            n1! (N − n1)! pn1 q N−n1 n1. (2.39)
            We can see that if the final factor n1 were absent on the right-hand side of the previous expression
            then it would just reduce to the binomial expansion, which we know how to sum. [See Equation (2.23).] We can take advantage of this fact using a rather elegant mathematical sleight of
            hand. Observe that because
            n1 pn1 ≡ p
            ∂
            ∂p
            pn1 , (2.40)
            the previous summation can be rewritten as
            
            n1=0,N
            N!
            n1! (N − n1)! pn1 q N−n1 n1 ≡ p
            ∂
            ∂p
            
            
            
            n1=0,N
            N!
            n1! (N − n1)! pn1 q N−n1
            
            . (2.41)
            The term in square brackets is now the familiar binomial expansion, and can be written more
            succinctly as (p + q) N. Thus,
            
            n1=0,N
            N!
            n1! (N − n1)! pn1 q N−n1 n1 = p
            ∂
            ∂p
            (p + q) N = p N (p + q) N−1
            . (2.42)
            However, p + q = 1 for the case in hand [see Equation (2.11)], so
            n1 = N p. (2.43)
            In fact, we could have guessed the previous result. By definition, the probability, p, is the number
            of occurrences of the outcome 1 divided by the number of trials, in the limit as the number of trials
            goes to infinity:
            p = lt N→∞
            n1
            N . (2.44)
            If we think carefully, however, we can see that taking the limit as the number of trials goes to
            infinity is equivalent to taking the mean value, so that
            p =
            
            
            n1
            N
            
            = n1
            N . (2.45)
            But, this is just a simple rearrangement of Equation (2.43).
            Probability Theory 21
            Let us now calculate the variance of n1. Recall, from Equation (2.36), that
            (∆n1) 2 = (n1) 2 − (n1) 2
            . (2.46)
            We already know n1, so we just need to calculate (n1) 2. This average is written
            (n1) 2 =
            
            n1=0,N
            N!
            n1! (N − n1)! pn1 q N−n1 (n1) 2
            . (2.47)
            The sum can be evaluated using a simple extension of the mathematical trick that we used previously to evaluate n1. Because
            (n1) 2 pn1 ≡
            
            p
            ∂
            ∂p
             2
            pn1 , (2.48)
            then

            N!
            n1! (N − n1)! pn1 q N−n1 (n1) 2 ≡
            
            p
            ∂
            ∂p

            
            n1=0,N
            N!
            n1! (N − n1)! pn1 q N−n1
            =
            
            p
            ∂
            ∂p
            2
            (p + q) N
            =
            
            p
            ∂

            p N (p + q) N−1
            
            = p
            
            N (p + q) N−1 + p N (N − 1) (p + q) N−2
            
            . (2.49)
            Using p + q = 1, we obtain
            (n1) 2 = p
            
            N + p N (N − 1)
            = N p 
            1 + p N − p
            
            = (N p) 2 + N pq = (n1)
            2 + N pq, (2.50)
            because n1 = N p. [See Equation (2.43).] It follows that the variance of n1 is given by
            (∆n1) 2 = (n1) 2 − (n1) 2 = N pq. (2.51)
            The standard deviation of n1 is the square root of the variance [see Equation (2.37)], so that
            ∆∗
            n1 = 
            N pq. (2.52)
            Recall that this quantity is essentially the width of the range over which n1 is distributed around its
            mean value. The relative width of the distribution is characterized by
            ∆∗
            n1
            n1
            =
            √

            p
            1
            √
            N
            . (2.53)
            It is clear, from this formula, that the relative width decreases with increasing N like N −1/2. So, the
            greater the number of trials, the more likely it is that an observation of n1 will yield a result that is
            relatively close to the mean value, n1.
            22 2.9. Gaussian Probability Distribution
            2.9 Gaussian Probability Distribution
            Consider a very large number of observations, N 
             1, made on a system with two possible outcomes. Suppose that the probability of outcome 1 is sufficiently large that the average number of
            occurrences after N observations is much greater than unity: that is,
            n1 = N p 
             1. (2.54)
            In this limit, the standard deviation of n1 is also much greater than unity,

            n1 = 
            N pq 
             1, (2.55)
            implying that there are very many probable values of n1 scattered about the mean value, n1. This
            suggests that the probability of obtaining n1 occurrences of outcome 1 does not change significantly
            in going from one possible value of n1 to an adjacent value. In other words,
            |PN(n1 + 1) − PN(n1)|
            PN(n1)
             1. (2.56)
            In this situation, it is useful to regard the probability as a smooth function of n1. Let n be a continuous variable that is interpreted as the number of occurrences of outcome 1 (after N observations)
            whenever it takes on a positive integer value. The probability that n lies between n and n + dn is
            defined
            P(n, n + dn) = P(n) dn, (2.57)
            where P(n) is called the probability density, and is independent of dn. The probability can be
            written in this form because P(n, n+dn) can always be expanded as a Taylor series in dn, and must
            go to zero as dn → 0. We can write
             n1+1/2
            n1−1/2
            P(n) dn = PN(n1), (2.58)
            which is equivalent to smearing out the discrete probability PN(n1) over the range n1 ± 1/2. Given
            Equations (2.38) and (2.56), the previous relation can be approximated as
            P(n)  PN(n) = N!
            n! (N − n)! pn q N−n
            . (2.59)
            For large N, the relative width of the probability distribution function is small: that is,
            ∆∗
            n1
            n1

             1. (2.60)
            This suggests that P(n) is strongly peaked around the mean value, n = n1. Suppose that ln P(n)
            attains its maximum value at n = n˜ (where we expect ˜n ∼ n1). Let us Taylor expand ln P(n) around
            Probability Theory 23
            n = n˜. Note that we are expanding the slowly-varying function ln P(n), rather than the rapidlyvarying function P(n), because the Taylor expansion of P(n) does not converge sufficiently rapidly
            in the vicinity of n = n˜ to be useful. We can write
            ln P(˜n + η)  ln P(˜n) + η B1 + η 2
            2
            B2 + ··· , (2.61)

            By definition,
            B1 = 0, (2.63)
            B2 < 0, (2.64)
            if n = n˜ corresponds to the maximum value of ln P(n).
            It follows from Equation (2.59) that
            ln P = ln N! − ln n! − ln (N − n)! + n ln p + (N − n) ln q. (2.65)
            If n is a large integer, such that n 
             1, then ln n! is almost a continuous function of n, because ln n!
            changes by only a relatively small amount when n is incremented by unity. Hence,
            d ln n!
            dn  ln (n + 1)! − ln n!
            1 = ln 

            
            = ln (n + 1), (2.66)
            giving
            d ln n!
            dn  ln n, (2.67)
            for n 
             1. The integral of this relation
            ln n!  n ln n − n + O(1), (2.68)
            valid for n 
             1, is called Stirling’s approximation, after the Scottish mathematician James Stirling,
            who first obtained it in 1730.
            According to Equations (2.62), (2.65), and (2.67),
            B1 = − ln ˜n + ln (N − n˜) + ln p − ln q. (2.69)
            Hence, if B1 = 0 then
            (N − n˜) p = n q˜ , (2.70)
            giving
            n˜ = N p = n1, (2.71)
            because p+q = 1. [See Equations (2.11) and (2.43).] Thus, the maximum of ln P(n) occurs exactly
            at the mean value of n, which equals n1.
            24 2.9. Gaussian Probability Distribution
            Further differentiation of Equation (2.69) yields [see Equation (2.62)]
            B2 = −1

            N pq, (2.72)
            because p + q = 1. Note that B2 < 0, as required. According to Equation (2.55), the previous
            relation can also be written
            B2 = − 1
            (∆∗n1) 2 . (2.73)
            It follows, from the previous analysis, that the Taylor expansion of ln P can be written
            ln P(n1 + η)  ln P(n1) − η 2
            2 (∆∗n1) 2 + ··· . (2.74)
            Taking the exponential of both sides, we obtain
            P(n)  P(n1) exp 
            −(n − n1) 2
            2 (∆∗n1) 2
            

            The constant P(n1) is most conveniently fixed by making use of the normalization condition

            n1=0,N
            PN(n1) = 1, (2.76)

            0
            P(n) dn  1 (2.77)
            for a continuous distribution function. Because we only expect P(n) to be significant when n lies
            in the relatively narrow range n1 ± ∆∗
            n1, the limits of integration in the previous expression can be
            replaced by ±∞ with negligible error. Thus,

            Probability Theory 25
            This is the famous Gaussian probability distribution, named after the German mathematician Carl
            Friedrich Gauss, who discovered it while investigating the distribution of errors in measurements.
            The Gaussian distribution is only valid in the limits N 
             1 and n1 
             1.
            Suppose we were to plot the probability PN(n1) against the integer variable n1, and then fit a
            continuous curve through the discrete points thus obtained. This curve would be equivalent to the
            continuous probability density curve P(n), where n is the continuous version of n1. According
            to Equation (2.81), the probability density attains its maximum value when n equals the mean
            of n1, and is also symmetric about this point. In fact, when plotted with the appropriate ratio of
            vertical to horizontal scalings, the Gaussian probability density curve looks rather like the outline
            of a bell centered on n = n1. Hence, this curve is sometimes called a bell curve. At one standard
            deviation away from the mean value—that is n = n1 ± ∆∗n1—the probability density is about 61%
            of its peak value. At two standard deviations away from the mean value, the probability density is
            about 13.5% of its peak value. Finally, at three standard deviations away from the mean value, the
            probability density is only about 1% of its peak value. We conclude that there is very little chance
            that n1 lies more than about three standard deviations away from its mean value. In other words,
            n1 is almost certain to lie in the relatively narrow range n1 ± 3 ∆∗
            n1.
            In the previous analysis, we went from a discrete probability function, PN(n1), to a continuous
            probability density, P(n). The normalization condition becomes
            1 =

            −∞
            P(n) dn (2.82)
            under this transformation. Likewise, the evaluations of the mean and variance of the distribution
            are written
            n1 =
            
            n1=0,N

            −∞
            P(n) (n − n1) 2 dn, (2.84)
            respectively. These results follow as simple generalizations of previously established results for
            the discrete function PN(n1). The limits of integration in the previous expressions can be approximated as ±∞ because P(n) is only non-negligible in a relatively narrow range of n. Finally, it
            is easily demonstrated that Equations (2.82)–(2.84) are indeed true by substituting in the Gaussian probability density, Equation (2.81), and then performing a few elementary integrals. (See
            Exercise 2.3.)
            2.10 Central Limit Theorem
            It may appear, at first sight, that the Gaussian distribution function is only relevant to two-state
            systems. In fact, as we shall see, the Gaussian probability distribution is of crucial importance to
            statistical physics because, under certain circumstances, it applies to all types of system.
            26 2.10. Central Limit Theorem
            Let us briefly review how we obtained the Gaussian distribution function in the first place. We
            started from a very simple system with only two possible outcomes. Of course, the probability
            distribution function (for n1) for this system did not look anything like a Gaussian. However, when
            we combined very many of these simple systems together, to produce a complicated system with
            a great number of possible outcomes, we found that the resultant probability distribution function
            (for n1) reduced to a Gaussian in the limit that the number of simple systems tended to infinity. We
            started from a two outcome system because it was easy to calculate the final probability distribution
            function when a finite number of such systems were combined together. Clearly, if we had started
            from a more complicated system then this calculation would have been far more difficult.
            Suppose that we start from a general system, with a general probability distribution function
            (for some measurable quantity x). It turns out that if we combine a sufficiently large number of
            such systems together then the resultant distribution function (for x) is always Gaussian. This astonishing result is known as the central limit theorem. Unfortunately, the central limit theorem is
            notoriously difficult to prove. A somewhat restricted proof is presented in Sections 1.10 and 1.11
            of Reif. The central limit theorem guarantees that the probability distribution of any measurable
            quantity is Gaussian, provided that a sufficiently large number of statistically independent observations are made. We can, therefore, confidently predict that Gaussian probability distributions are
            going to crop up very frequently in statistical thermodynamics.

            3.2 Specification of State of Many-Particle System
            Let us first consider how we might specify the state of a many-particle system. Consider the

            in one dimension. Assuming that we know the particle’s equation of motion, the state of the system
            is fully specified once we simultaneously measure the particle’s displacement, q, and momentum,
            p. In principle, if we know q and p then we can calculate the state of the system at all subsequent
            times using the equation of motion. In practice, it is impossible to specify q and p exactly, because
            there is always an intrinsic error in any experimental measurement.
            Consider the time evolution of q and p. This can be visualized by plotting the point (q, p) in
            the q-p plane. This plane is generally known as phase-space. In general, as time progresses, the
            point (q, p) will trace out some very complicated pattern in phase-space. Suppose that we divide
            phase-space into rectangular cells of uniform dimensions δq and δp. Here, δq is the intrinsic error
            in the position measurement, and δp the intrinsic error in the momentum measurement. The area
            of each cell is
            δq δp = h0, (3.1)
            where h0 is a small constant having the dimensions of angular momentum. The coordinates q and
            p can now be conveniently specified by indicating the cell in phase-space into which they plot at
            any given time. This procedure automatically ensures that we do not attempt to specify q and p to
            an accuracy greater than our experimental error, which would clearly be pointless.
            Let us now consider a single spinless particle moving in three dimensions. In order to specify
            the state of the system, we now need to know three q-p pairs: that is, qx-px, qy-py, and qz-pz.
            Incidentally, the number of q-p pairs needed to specify the state of the system is usually called the
            number of degrees of freedom of the system. (See Section B.1.) Thus, a single particle moving
            in one dimension constitutes a one degree of freedom system, whereas a single particle moving in
            three dimensions constitutes a three degree of freedom system.
            Consider the time evolution of q and p, where q = (qx, qy, qz), et cetera. This can be visualized by plotting the point (q, p) in the six-dimensional q-p phase-space. Suppose that we divide
            the qx-px plane into rectangular cells of uniform dimensions δq and δp, and do likewise for the
            qy-py and qz-pz planes. Here, δq and δp are again the intrinsic errors in our measurements of
            position and momentum, respectively. This is equivalent to dividing phase-space up into regular
            six-dimensional cells of volume h3
            0 . The coordinates q and p can now be conveniently specified
            by indicating the cell in phase-space into which they plot at any given time. Again, this procedure
            30 3.2. Specification of State of Many-Particle System
            automatically ensures that we do not attempt to specify q and p to an accuracy greater than our
            experimental error.
            Finally, let us consider a system consisting of N spinless particles moving classically in three
            dimensions. In order to specify the state of the system, we need to specify a large number of
            q-p pairs. The requisite number is simply the number of degrees of freedom, f . For the present
            case, f = 3N, because each particle needs three q-p pairs. Thus, phase-space (i.e., the space of
            all the q-p pairs) now possesses 2 f = 6N dimensions. Consider a particular pair of conjugate
            (see Section B.4) phase-space coordinates, qi and pi. As before, we divide the qi-pi plane into
            rectangular cells of uniform dimensions δq and δp. This is equivalent to dividing phase-space into
            regular 2 f dimensional cells of volume h f
            0 . The state of the system is specified by indicating which
            cell it occupies in phase-space at any given time.
            In principle, we can specify the state of the system to arbitrary accuracy, by taking the limit
            h0 → 0. In reality, we know from Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (see Section C.8) that it is
            impossible to simultaneously measure a coordinate, qi, and its conjugate momentum, pi, to greater
            accuracy than δqi δpi = /2. Here,  is Planck’s constant divided by 2π. This implies that
            h0 ≥ /2. (3.2)
            In other words, the uncertainty principle sets a lower limit on how finely we can chop up classical
            phase-space.
            In quantum mechanics, we can specify the state of the system by giving its wavefunction at
            time t,
            ψ(q1, ··· , qf , s1, ··· , sg, t), (3.3)
            where f is the number of translational degrees of freedom, and g the number of internal (e.g., spin)
            degrees of freedom. (See Appendix C.) For instance, if the system consists of N spin-one-half
            particles then there will be 3N translational degrees of freedom, and N spin degrees of freedom
            (because the spin of each particle can either be directed up or down along the z-axis). Alternatively,
            if the system is in a stationary state (i.e., an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian) then we can just specify
            f + g quantum numbers. (See Sections C.9 and C.10.) Either way, the future time evolution
            of the wavefunction is fully determined by Schr¨odinger’s equation. In reality, this approach is
            not practical because the Hamiltonian of the system is only known approximately. Typically,
            we are dealing with a system consisting of many weakly-interacting particles. We usually know
            the Hamiltonian for completely non-interacting particles, but the component of the Hamiltonian
            associated with particle interactions is either impossibly complicated, or not very well known. We
            can define approximate stationary eigenstates using the Hamiltonian for non-interacting particles.
            The state of the system is then specified by the quantum numbers identifying these eigenstates. In
            the absence of particle interactions, if the system starts off in a stationary state then it stays in that
            state for ever, so its quantum numbers never change. The interactions allow the system to make
            transitions between different “stationary” states, causing its quantum numbers to change in time.
            Statistical Mechanics 31
            3.3 Principle of Equal A Priori Probabilities
            We now know how to specify the instantaneous state of a many-particle system. In principle, such
            a system is completely deterministic. Once we know the initial state, and the equations of motion
            (or the Hamiltonian), we can evolve the system forward in time, and, thereby, determine all future
            states. In reality, it is quite impossible to specify the initial state, or the equations of motion, to
            sufficient accuracy for this method to have any chance of working. Furthermore, even if it were
            possible, it would still not be a practical proposition to evolve the equations of motion. Remember
            that we are typically dealing with systems containing Avogadro’s number of particles: that is,
            about 1024 particles. We cannot evolve 1024 simultaneous differential equations. Even if we could,
            we would not want to. After all, we are not particularly interested in the motions of individual
            particles. What we really want is statistical information regarding the motions of all particles in
            the system.
            Clearly, what is required here is a statistical treatment of the problem. Instead of focusing on
            a single system, let us proceed, in the usual manner, and consider a statistical ensemble consisting
            of a large number of identical systems. (See Section 2.2.) In general, these systems are distributed
            over many different states at any given time. In order to evaluate the probability that the system
            possesses a particular property, we merely need to find the number of systems in the ensemble
            that exhibit this property, and then divide by the total number of systems, in the limit as the latter
            number tends to infinity.
            We can usually place some general constraints on the system. Typically, we know the total
            energy, E, the total volume, V, and the total number of particles, N. To be more exact, we can only
            really say that the total energy lies between E and E + δE, et cetera, where δE is an experimental
            error. Thus, we need only concern ourselves with those systems in the ensemble exhibiting states
            that are consistent with the known constraints. We shall call these the states accessible to the
            system. In general, there are a great many such states.
            We now need to calculate the probability of the system being found in each of its accessible
            states. In fact, the only way that we could “calculate” these probabilities would be to evolve all
            of the systems in the ensemble in time, and observe how long, on average, they spend in each
            accessible state. But, as we have already discussed, such a calculation is completely out of the
            question. Instead, we shall effectively guess the probabilities.
            Let us consider an isolated system in equilibrium. In this situation, we would expect the probability of the system being found in one of its accessible states to be independent of time. This
            implies that the statistical ensemble does not evolve with time. Individual systems in the ensemble
            will constantly change state, but the average number of systems in any given state should remain
            constant. Thus, all macroscopic parameters describing the system, such as the energy and the volume, should also remain constant. There is nothing in the laws of mechanics that would lead us to
            suppose that the system will be found more often in one of its accessible states than in another. We
            assume, therefore, that the system is equally likely to be found in any of its accessible states. This is
            called the assumption of equal a priori probabilities, and lies at the heart of statistical mechanics.
            In fact, we use assumptions like this all of the time without really thinking about them. Suppose
            that we were asked to pick a card at random from a well-shuffled pack of ordinary playing cards.
            Most people would accept that we have an equal probability of picking any card in the pack. There
            32 3.4. H-Theorem
            is nothing that would favor one particular card over all of the others. Hence, because there are
            fifty-two cards in a normal pack, we would expect the probability of picking the ace of spades, say,
            to be 1/52. We could now place some constraints on the system. For instance, we could only count
            red cards, in which case the probability of picking the ace of hearts, say, would be 1/26, by the
            same reasoning. In both cases, we have used the principle of equal a priori probabilities. People
            really believe that this principle applies to games of chance, such as cards, dice, and roulette. In
            fact, if the principle were found not to apply to a particular game then most people would conclude
            that the game was crooked. But, imagine trying to prove that the principle actually does apply to
            a game of cards. This would be a very difficult task. We would have to show that the way most
            people shuffle cards is effective at randomizing their order. A convincing study would have to be
            part mathematics and part psychology.
            In statistical mechanics, we treat a many-particle system a little like an extremely large game of
            cards. Each accessible state corresponds to one of the cards in the pack. The interactions between
            particles cause the system to continually change state. This is equivalent to constantly shuffling the
            pack. Finally, an observation of the state of the system is like picking a card at random from the
            pack. The principle of equal a priori probabilities then boils down to saying that we have an equal
            chance of choosing any particular card.
            It is, unfortunately, impossible to prove with mathematical rigor that the principle of equal a
            priori probabilities applies to many-particle systems. Over the years, many people have attempted
            this proof, and all have failed. Not surprisingly, therefore, statistical mechanics was greeted with
            a great deal of scepticism when it was first proposed in the late 1800’s. One of the its main
            proponents, Ludvig Boltzmann, became so discouraged by all of the criticism that he eventually
            committed suicide. Nowadays, statistical mechanics is completely accepted into the cannon of
            physics—quite simply because it works.
            It is actually possible to formulate a reasonably convincing scientific case for the principle of
            equal a priori probabilities. To achieve this we have to make use of the so-called H-theorem.
            3.4 H-Theorem
            Consider a system of weakly-interacting particles. In quantum mechanics, we can write the Hamiltonian for such a system as
            H = H0 + H1, (3.4)
            where H0 is the Hamiltonian for completely non-interacting particles, and H1 a small correction
            due to the particle interactions. We can define approximate stationary eigenstates of the system
            using H0. Thus,
            H0 Ψr = Er Ψr, (3.5)
            where the index r labels a state of energy Er and eigenstate Ψr. (See Section C.9.) In general, there
            are many different eigenstates with the same energy—these are called degenerate states. (See
            Section C.10.)
            For example, consider N non-interacting spinless particles of mass m confined in a cubic box
            of dimension L. According to standard wave-mechanics, the energy levels of the ith particle are
            Statistical Mechanics 33
            given by
            ei = 2
            π2
            2 m L2
            
            n2
            1 i + n2
            2 i + n2
            3 i
            
            , (3.6)
            where n1 i, n2 i, and n3 i are three (positive integer) quantum numbers. (See Section C.10.) The
            overall energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles, so that for a
            general state r,
            Er =
            
            i=1,N
            ei. (3.7)
            The overall state of the system is thus specified by 3N quantum numbers (i.e., three quantum numbers per particle). There are clearly very many different arrangements of these quantum numbers
            that give the same overall energy.
            Consider, now, a statistical ensemble of systems made up of weakly-interacting particles. Suppose that this ensemble is initially very far from equilibrium. For instance, the systems in the
            ensemble might only be distributed over a very small subset of their accessible states. If each system starts off in a particular stationary state (i.e., with a particular set of quantum numbers) then,
            in the absence of particle interactions, it will remain in that state for ever. Hence, the ensemble
            will always stay far from equilibrium, and the principle of equal a priori probabilities will never be
            applicable. In reality, particle interactions cause each system in the ensemble to make transitions
            between its accessible “stationary” states. This allows the overall state of the ensemble to change
            in time.
            Let us label the accessible states of our system by the index r. We can ascribe a time-dependent
            probability, Pr(t), of finding the system in a particular approximate stationary state r at time t. Of
            course, Pr(t) is proportional to the number of systems in the ensemble in state r at time t. In
            general, Pr is time-dependent because the ensemble is evolving towards an equilibrium state. Let
            us assume that the probabilities are properly normalized, so that the sum over all accessible states
            always yields unity: that is,
            
            r
            Pr(t) = 1. (3.8)
            Small interactions between particles cause transitions between the approximate stationary states
            of the system. Thus, there exists some transition probability per unit time, Wrs, that a system originally in state r ends up in state s as a result of these interactions. Likewise, there exists a probability
            per unit time Wsr that a system in state s makes a transition to state r. These transition probabilities
            are meaningful in quantum mechanics provided that the particle interaction strength is sufficiently
            small, there is a nearly continuous distribution of accessible energy levels, and we consider time intervals that are not too small. These conditions are easily satisfied for the types of systems usually
            analyzed via statistical mechanics (e.g., nearly-ideal gases). One important conclusion of quantum mechanics is that the forward and backward transition probabilities between two states are the
            same, so that
            Wrs = Wsr (3.9)
            for any two states r and s. This result follows from the time-reversal symmetry of quantum mechanics. On the microscopic scale of individual particles, all fundamental laws of physics (in
            particular, classical and quantum mechanics) possess this symmetry. So, if a certain motion of
            34 3.4. H-Theorem
            particles satisfies the classical equations of motion (or Schr¨odinger’s equation) then the reversed
            motion, with all particles starting off from their final positions and then retracing their paths exactly
            until they reach their initial positions, satisfies these equations just as well.
            Suppose that we were to “film” a microscopic process, such as two classical particles approaching one another, colliding, and moving apart. We could then gather an audience together and show
            them the film. To make things slightly more interesting we could play it either forwards or backwards. Because of the time-reversal symmetry of classical mechanics, the audience would not
            be able to tell which way the film was running. In both cases, the film would show completely
            plausible physical events.
            We can play the same game for a quantum process. For instance, we could “film” a group of
            photons impinging on some atoms. Occasionally, one of the atoms will absorb a photon and make a
            transition to an excited state (i.e., a state with higher than normal energy). We could easily estimate
            the rate constant for this process by watching the film carefully. If we play the film backwards then
            it will appear to show excited atoms occasionally emitting a photon, and then decaying back to
            their unexcited state. If quantum mechanics possesses time-reversal symmetry (which it certainly
            does) then both films should appear equally plausible. This means that the rate constant for the
            absorption of a photon to produce an excited state must be the same as the rate constant for the
            excited state to decay by the emission of a photon. Otherwise, in the backwards film, the excited
            atoms would appear to emit photons at the wrong rate, and we could then tell that the film was
            being played backwards. It follows, therefore, that, as a consequence of time-reversal symmetry,
            the rate constant for any process in quantum mechanics must equal the rate constant for the inverse
            process.
            The probability, Pr, of finding the systems in the ensemble in a particular state r changes with
            time for two reasons. Firstly, systems in another state s can make transitions to the state r. The
            rate at which this occurs is Ps, the probability that the systems are in the state s to begin with,
            multiplied by the rate constant of the transition Wsr. Secondly, systems in the state r can make
            transitions to other states such as s. The rate at which this occurs is clearly Pr times Wrs. We can,
            thus, write a simple differential equation for the time evolution of Pr:
            dPr
            dt =
            
            sr
            PsWsr −
            
            sr
            PrWrs, (3.10)
            or
            dPr
            dt =
            
            s
            Wrs(Ps − Pr), (3.11)
            where use has been made of the symmetry condition (3.9). The summation is over all accessible
            states.
            Consider now the quantity H (from which the H-theorem derives its name), which is defined
            as the average value of ln Pr taken over all accessible states:
            H ≡ ln Pr =
            
            r
            Pr ln Pr. (3.12)
            Statistical Mechanics 35
            This quantity changes as the individual probabilities Pr vary in time. Straightforward differentiation of the previous equation yields
            dH
            dt =
            
            r

            =
            
            r
            dPr
            dt (ln Pr + 1). (3.13)
            According to Equation (3.11), this can be written
            dH
            dt =
            
            r
            
            s
            Wrs (Ps − Pr) (ln Pr + 1). (3.14)
            We can now interchange the dummy summations indices r and s to give
            dH
            dt =
            
            r
            
            s
            Wsr (Pr − Ps) (ln Ps + 1). (3.15)
            Finally, we can write dH/dt in a more symmetric form by adding the previous two equations, and
            then making use of Equation (3.9):
            dH
            dt = −1
            2
            
            r
            
            s
            Wrs (Pr − Ps) (ln Pr − ln Ps). (3.16)
            Note, however, that ln Pr is a monotonically increasing function of Pr. It follows that ln Pr > ln Ps
            whenever Pr > Ps, and vice versa. Thus, in general, the right-hand side of the previous equation is
            the sum of many negative contributions. Hence, we conclude that
            dH
            dt ≤ 0. (3.17)
            The equality sign only holds in the special case where all accessible states are equally probable,
            so that Pr = Ps for all r and s. This result is called the H-theorem, and was first proved by the
            unfortunate Professor Boltzmann.
            The H-theorem tells us that if an isolated system is initially not in equilibrium then it will
            evolve in time, under the influence of particle interactions, in such a manner that the quantity H
            always decreases. This process will continue until H reaches its minimum possible value, at which
            point dH/dt = 0, and there is no further evolution of the system. According to Equation (3.16),
            in this final equilibrium state, the system is equally likely to be found in any one of its accessible
            states. This is, of course, the situation predicted by the principle of equal a priori probabilities.
            The previous argument does not constitute a mathematically rigorous proof that the principle
            of equal a priori probabilities applies to many-particle systems, because we tacitly made an unwarranted assumption. That is, we assumed that the probability of the system making a transition
            from some state r to another state s is independent of the past history of the system. In general, this
            is not the case in physical systems, although there are many situations in which it is a fairly good
            approximation. Thus, the epistemological status of the principle of equal a priori probabilities is
            that it is plausible, but remains unproven. As we have already mentioned, the ultimate justification for this principle is empirical—it leads to theoretical predictions that are in accordance with
            experimental observations.
            36 3.5. Relaxation Time
            3.5 Relaxation Time
            The H-theorem guarantees that an isolated many-particle system will eventually reach an equilibrium state, irrespective of its initial state. The typical time required for this process to take place
            is called the relaxation time, and depends, in detail, on the nature of the inter-particle interactions.
            The principle of equal a priori probabilities is only valid for equilibrium states. It follows that we
            can only safely apply this principle to systems that have remained undisturbed for many relaxation
            times since they were setup, or last interacted with the outside world.
            The relaxation time for the air in a typical classroom is very much less than one second. This
            suggests that such air is probably in equilibrium most of the time, and should, therefore, be governed by the principle of equal a priori probabilities. In fact, this is known to be the case.
            Consider another example. Our galaxy, the “Milky Way,” is an isolated dynamical system
            made up of about 1011 stars. In fact, it can be thought of as a self-gravitating “gas” of stars. At
            first sight, the Milky Way would seem to be an ideal system on which to test out the ideas of
            statistical mechanics. Stars in the Milky Way interact via occasional near-miss events in which
            they exchange energy and momentum. Actual collisions are very rare indeed. Unfortunately, such
            interactions take place very infrequently, because there is a lot of empty space between the stars.
            The best estimate for the relaxation time of the Milky Way is about 1013 years. This should be
            compared with the estimated age of the Milky Way, which is only about 1010 years. It is clear
            that, despite its great age, the Milky Way has not been around long enough to reach an equilibrium
            state. This suggests that the principle of equal a priori probabilities cannot be used to describe
            stellar dynamics. Not surprisingly, the observed velocity distribution of the stars in the vicinity of
            the Sun is not governed by this principle.
            3.6 Reversibility and Irreversibility
            Previously, we mentioned that, on a microscopic level, the laws of physics are invariant under timereversal. In other words, microscopic phenomena look physically plausible when run in reverse.
            We usually say that these phenomena are reversible. Does this imply that macroscopic phenomena
            are also reversible? Consider an isolated many-particle system that starts off far from equilibrium.
            According to the H-theorem, it will evolve towards equilibrium and, as it does so, the macroscopic
            quantity H will decrease. But, if we run this process backwards in time then the system will appear
            to evolve away from equilibrium, and the quantity H will increase. This type of behavior is not
            physical because it violates the H-theorem. In other words, if we saw a film of a macroscopic
            process then we could very easily tell if it was being run backwards.
            For instance, suppose that, by some miracle, we were able to move all of the oxygen molecules
            in the air in some classroom to one side of the room, and all of the nitrogen molecules to the
            opposite side. We would not expect this state to persist for very long. Pretty soon the oxygen and
            nitrogen molecules would start to intermingle, and this process would continue until they were
            thoroughly mixed together throughout the room. This, of course, is the equilibrium state for air.
            In reverse, this process appears completely unphysical. We would start off from perfectly normal
            air, and suddenly, for no good reason, the air’s constituent oxygen and nitrogen molecules would
            Statistical Mechanics 37
            appear to separate, and move to opposite sides of the room. This scenario is not impossible, but,
            from everything we know about the world around us, it is spectacularly unlikely. We conclude,
            therefore, that macroscopic phenomena are generally irreversible, because they appear unphysical
            when run in reverse.
            How does the irreversibility of macroscopic phenomena arise? It certainly does not come from
            the fundamental laws of physics, because these laws are all reversible. In the previous example,
            the oxygen and nitrogen molecules intermingled by continually scattering off one another. Each
            individual scattering event would look perfectly reasonable viewed in reverse. However, the net
            result of these scattering event appears unphysical when run backwards. How can we obtain an
            irreversible process from the combined effects of very many reversible processes? This is a vitally
            important question. Unfortunately, we are not quite at the stage where we can formulate a convincing answer. (We shall answer the question in Section 5.6.) Note, however, that the essential
            irreversibility of macroscopic phenomena is one of the key results of statistical thermodynamics.
            3.7 Probability Calculations
            The principle of equal a priori probabilities is fundamental to all of statistical mechanics, and allows a complete description of the properties of macroscopic systems in equilibrium. In principle,
            statistical mechanics calculations are very simple. Consider a system in equilibrium that is isolated, so that its total energy is known to have a constant value lying somewhere in the range E to
            E + δE. In order to make statistical predictions, we focus attention on an ensemble of such systems, all of which have their energy in this range. Let Ω(E) be the total number of different states
            in the ensemble with energies in the specified range. Suppose that, among these states, there are a
            number Ω(E; yk) for which some parameter, y, of the system assumes the discrete value yk. (This
            discussion can easily be generalized to deal with a parameter that can assume a continuous range
            of values.) The principle of equal a priori probabilities tells us that all of the Ω(E) accessible states
            of the system are equally likely to occur in the ensemble. It follows that the probability, P(yk), that
            the parameter y of the system assumes the value yk is simply
            P(yk) = Ω(E; yk)
            Ω(E) . (3.18)
            Clearly, the mean value of y for the system is given by
            y¯ =
            
            k Ω(E; yk) yk
            Ω(E) , (3.19)
            where the sum is over all possible values that y can assume. In the previous formula, it is tacitly
            assumed that Ω(E) → ∞, which is generally the case in thermodynamic systems.
            It can be seen that, using the principle of equal a priori probabilities, all calculations in statistical mechanics reduce to counting states, subject to various constraints. In principle, this is a fairly
            straightforward task. In practice, problems arise if the constraints become too complicated. These
            problems can usually be overcome with a little mathematical ingenuity. Nevertheless, there is no
            doubt that this type of calculation is far easier than trying to solve the classical equations of motion
            (or Schr¨odinger’s equation) directly for a many-particle system.
            38 3.8. Behavior of Density of States
            3.8 Behavior of Density of States
            Consider an isolated system in equilibrium whose volume is V, and whose energy lies in the range
            E to E +δE. Let Ω(E, V) be the total number of microscopic states that satisfy these constraints. It
            would be useful if we could estimate how this number typically varies with the macroscopic parameters of the system. The easiest way to do this is to consider a specific example. For instance, an
            ideal gas made up of spinless monatomic particles. This is a particularly simple example, because,
            for such a gas, the particles possess translational, but no internal (e.g., vibrational, rotational, or
            spin), degrees of freedom. By definition, interatomic forces are negligible in an ideal gas. In other
            words, the individual particles move in an approximately uniform potential. It follows that the
            energy of the gas is just the total translational kinetic energy of its constituent particles. In other
            words,
            E = 1
            2 m
            
            i=1,N
            p2
            i , (3.20)
            where m is the particle mass, N the total number of particles, and pi the vector momentum of the
            ith particle.
            Consider the system in the limit in which the energy, E, of the gas is much greater than the
            ground-state energy, so that all of the quantum numbers are large. The classical version of statistical mechanics, in which we divide up phase-space into cells of equal volume, is valid in this
            limit. The number of states, Ω(E, V), lying between the energies E and E + δE is simply equal to
            the number of cells in phase-space contained between these energies. In other words, Ω(E, V) is
            proportional to the volume of phase-space between these two energies:
            Ω(E, V) ∝
             E+δE
            E
            d 3
            r1 ··· d 3
            rN d 3
            p1 ··· d 3
            pN. (3.21)
            Here, the integrand is the element of volume of phase-space, with
            d 3
            ri ≡ dxi dyi dzi, (3.22)
            d 3
            pi ≡ d px i d py i d pz i, (3.23)
            where (xi, yi, zi) and (px i, py i, pz i) are the Cartesian coordinates and momentum components of the
            ith particle, respectively. The integration is over all coordinates and momenta such that the total
            energy of the system lies between E and E + δE.
            For an ideal gas, the total energy E does not depend on the positions of the particles. [See
            Equation (3.20).] This implies that the integration over the position vectors, ri, can be performed
            immediately. Because each integral over ri extends over the volume of the container (the particles
            are, of course, not allowed to stray outside the container), 
            d 3
            ri = V. There are N such integrals,
            so Equation (3.21) reduces to
            Ω(E, V) ∝ V Nχ(E), (3.24)
            where
            χ(E) ∝
             E+δE
            E
            d 3

            pN (3.25)
            Statistical Mechanics 39
            is a momentum-space integral that is independent of the volume.
            The energy of the system can be written
            E = 1
            2 m
            
            i=1,N

            α=1,3
            p2
            α i
            , (3.26)
            because p2
            i = p2
            1 i + p2
            2 i + p2
            3 i
            , denoting the (x, y, z) components by (1, 2, 3), respectively. The
            previous sum contains 3N square terms. For E = constant, Equation (3.26) describes the locus of
            a sphere of radius R(E) = (2 m E)
            1/2 in the 3N-dimensional space of the momentum components.
            Hence, χ(E) is proportional to the volume of momentum phase-space contained in the region lying
            between the sphere of radius R(E), and that of slightly larger radius R(E + δE). This volume is
            proportional to the area of the inner sphere multiplied by δR ≡ R(E +δE)−R(E). Because the area
            varies like R3N−1, and δR ∝ δE/E 1/2, we have
            χ(E) ∝ R3N−1
            /E 1/2 ∝ E 3N/2−1
            . (3.27)
            Combining this result with Equation (3.24), we obtain
            Ω(E, V)  B V NE 3N/2
            , (3.28)
            where B is a constant independent of V or E, and we have also made use of the fact that N 
             1.
            Note that, because the number of degrees of freedom of the system is f = 3N, the previous relation
            can be very approximately written
            Ω(E, V) ∝ V f
            E f
            . (3.29)
            In other words, the density of states varies like the extensive macroscopic parameters of the system
            raised to the power of the number of degrees of freedom. An extensive parameter is one that scales
            with the size of the system (e.g., the volume). (See Section 7.8.) Because thermodynamic systems
            generally possess a very large number of degrees of freedom, this result implies that the density of
            states is an exceptionally rapidly increasing function of the energy and volume. This result, which
            turns out to be quite general, is of great significance in statistical thermodynamics.

            Here, H(q1, ··· , qf , p1, ··· , pf , t) is the Hamiltonian of the system. Consider a statistical
            ensemble of such systems. Let ρ(q1, ··· , qf , p1, ··· , pf , t) be the number density of systems
            in phase-space. In other words, let ρ(q1, ··· , qf , p1, ··· , pf , t) dq1 dq2 ··· dqf d p1 d p2 ··· d pf
            be the number of states with q1 lying between q1 and q1 + dq1, p1 lying between p1 and

            (i.e., q1, ··· , qf and p1, ··· , pf) becomes very large. This is equivalent to assuming

            This result demonstrates that the system will naturally evolve towards a final equilibrium
            state in which all of its macroscopic variables have Gaussian probability distributions,
            which is in accordance with the central limit theorem. (See Section 2.10.)

            4 Heat and Work
            4.1 Brief History of Heat and Work
            In 1789, the French scientist Antoine Lavoisier published a famous treatise on chemistry which,
            among other things, demolished the then prevalent theory of combustion. This theory, known to
            history as the phlogiston theory, is so extraordinary stupid that it is not even worth describing. In
            place of phlogiston theory, Lavoisier proposed the first reasonably sensible scientific interpretation
            of heat. Lavoisier pictured heat as an invisible, tasteless, odorless, weightless fluid, which he
            called calorific fluid. He postulated that hot bodies contain more of this fluid than cold bodies.
            Furthermore, he suggested that the constituent particles of calorific fluid repel one another, causing
            heat to flow spontaneously from hot to cold bodies when they are placed in thermal contact.
            The modern interpretation of heat is, or course, somewhat different to Lavoisier’s calorific
            theory. Nevertheless, there is an important subset of problems, involving heat flow, for which
            Lavoisier’s approach is rather useful. These problems often crop up as examination questions. For
            example: “A clean dry copper calorimeter contains 100 grams of water at 30◦ degrees centigrade.
            A 10 gram block of copper heated to 60◦ centigrade is added. What is the final temperature of the
            mixture?”. How do we approach this type of problem? According to Lavoisier’s theory, there is an
            analogy between heat flow and incompressible fluid flow under gravity. The same volume of liquid
            added to containers of different (uniform) cross-sectional area fills them to different heights. If the
            volume is V, and the cross-sectional area is A, then the height is h = V/A. In a similar manner,
            the same quantity of heat added to different bodies causes them to rise to different temperatures.
            If Q is the heat and θ is the (absolute) temperature then θ = Q/C, where the constant C is termed
            the heat capacity. [This is a somewhat oversimplified example. In general, the heat capacity is
            a function of temperature, so that C = C(θ).] If two containers, filled to different heights, with a
            free-flowing incompressible fluid are connected together at the bottom, via a small pipe, then fluid
            will flow under gravity, from one to the other, until the two heights are the same. The final height
            is easily calculated by equating the total fluid volume in the initial and final states. Thus,
            h1 A1 + h2 A2 = h A1 + h A2, (4.1)
            giving
            h = h1 A1 + h2 A2
            A1 + A2
            . (4.2)
            Here, h1 and h2 are the initial heights in the two containers, A1 and A2 are the corresponding crosssectional areas, and h is the final height. Likewise, if two bodies, initially at different temperatures,
            are brought into thermal contact then heat will flow, from one to the other, until the two temperatures are the same. The final temperature is calculated by equating the total heat in the initial and
            final states. Thus,
            θ1 C1 + θ2 C2 = θC1 + θC2, (4.3)
            44 4.1. Brief History of Heat and Work
            giving
            θ = θ1 C1 + θ2 C2
            C1 + C2
            , (4.4)
            where the meaning of the various symbols should be self-evident.
            The analogy between heat flow and fluid flow works because, in Lavoisier’s theory, heat is a
            conserved quantity, just like the volume of an incompressible fluid. In fact, Lavoisier postulated
            that heat was an element. Note that atoms were thought to be indestructible before nuclear reactions
            were discovered, so the total amount of each element in the cosmos was assumed to be a constant.
            Thus, if Lavoisier had cared to formulate a law of thermodynamics from his calorific theory then
            he would have said that the total amount of heat in the universe was a constant.
            In 1798, Benjamin Thompson, an Englishman who spent his early years in pre-revolutionary
            America, was minister for war and police in the German state of Bavaria. One of his jobs was
            to oversee the boring of cannons in the state arsenal. Thompson was struck by the enormous, and
            seemingly inexhaustible, amount of heat generated in this process. He simply could not understand
            where all this heat was coming from. According to Lavoisier’s calorific theory, the heat must
            flow into the cannon from its immediate surroundings, which should, therefore, become colder.
            The flow should also eventually cease when all of the available heat has been extracted. In fact,
            Thompson observed that the surroundings of the cannon got hotter, not colder, and that the heating
            process continued unabated as long as the boring machine was operating. Thompson postulated
            that some of the mechanical work done on the cannon by the boring machine was being converted
            into heat. At the time, this was quite a revolutionary concept, and most people were not ready to
            accept it. This is somewhat surprising, because, by the end of the eighteenth century, the conversion
            of heat into work, by steam engines, was quite commonplace. Nevertheless, the conversion of work
            into heat did not gain broad acceptance until 1849, when an English physicist called James Prescott
            Joule published the results of a long and painstaking series of experiments. Joule confirmed that
            work could indeed be converted into heat. Moreover, he found that the same amount of work
            always generates the same quantity of heat. This is true regardless of the nature of the work (e.g.,
            mechanical, electrical, et cetera). Joule was able to formulate what became known as the work
            equivalent of heat. Namely, that 1 newton meter of work is equivalent to 0.241 calories of heat.
            A calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree
            centigrade. Nowadays, we measure both heat and work using the same units, so that one newton
            meter, or joule, of work is equivalent to one joule of heat.
            In 1850, the German physicist Clausius correctly postulated that the essential conserved quantity is neither heat nor work, but some combination of the two which quickly became known as
            energy, from the Greek energeia meaning “activity” or “action.” According to Clausius, the change
            in the internal energy of a macroscopic body can be written
            ∆E = Q − W, (4.5)
            where Q is the heat absorbed from the surroundings, and W is the work done on the surroundings.
            This relation is known as the first law of thermodynamics.
            Heat and Work 45
            4.2 Macrostates and Microstates
            In describing a system made up of a great many particles, it is usually possible to specify some
            macroscopically measurable independent parameters, x1, x2, ··· , xn, that affect the particles’ equations of motion. These parameters are termed the external parameters of the system. Examples
            of such parameters are the volume (this gets into the equations of motion because the potential
            energy becomes infinite when a particle strays outside the available volume), and any applied electric and magnetic fields. A microstate of the system is defined as a state for which the motions of
            the individual particles are completely specified (subject, of course, to the unavoidable limitations
            imposed by the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics). In general, the overall energy of a
            given microstate, r, is a function of the external parameters:
            Er ≡ Er(x1, x2, ··· , xn). (4.6)
            A macrostate of the system is defined by specifying the external parameters, and any other constraints to which the system is subject. For example, if we are dealing with an isolated system (i.e.,
            one that can neither exchange heat with, nor do work on, its surroundings) then the macrostate
            might be specified by giving the values of the volume and the constant total energy. For a manyparticle system, there are generally a very great number of microstates that are consistent with a
            given macrostate.
            4.3 Microscopic Interpretation of Heat and Work
            Consider a macroscopic system, A, that is known to be in a given macrostate. To be more exact,
            consider an ensemble of similar macroscopic systems, A, where each system in the ensemble is in
            one of the many microstates consistent with the given macrostate. There are two fundamentally
            different ways in which the average energy of A can change due to interaction with its surroundings.
            If the external parameters of the system remain constant then the interaction is termed a purely
            thermal interaction. Any change in the average energy of the system is attributed to an exchange
            of heat with its environment. Thus,
            ∆E = Q, (4.7)
            where Q is the heat absorbed by the system. On a microscopic level, the energies of the individual
            microstates are unaffected by the absorption of heat. In fact, it is the distribution of the systems in
            the ensemble over the various microstates that is modified.
            Suppose that the system A is thermally insulated from its environment. This can be achieved by
            surrounding it by an adiabatic envelope (i.e., an envelope fabricated out of a material that is a poor
            conductor of heat, such a fiber glass). Incidentally, the term adiabatic is derived from the Greek
            adiabatos, which means “impassable.” In scientific terminology, an adiabatic process is one in
            which there is no exchange of heat. The system A is still capable of interacting with its environment
            via its external parameters. This type of interaction is termed mechanical interaction, and any
            change in the average energy of the system is attributed to work done on it by its surroundings.
            Thus,
            ∆E = −W, (4.8)
            46 4.4. Quasi-Static Processes
            where W is the work done by the system on its environment. On a microscopic level, the energy of
            the system changes because the energies of the individual microstates are functions of the external
            parameters. [See Equation (4.6).] Thus, if the external parameters are changed then, in general,
            the energies of all of the systems in the ensemble are modified (because each is in a specific microstate). Such a modification usually gives rise to a redistribution of the systems in the ensemble
            over the accessible microstates (without any heat exchange with the environment). Clearly, from a
            microscopic viewpoint, performing work on a macroscopic system is quite a complicated process.
            Nevertheless, macroscopic work is a quantity that is easy to measure experimentally. For instance,
            if the system A exerts a force F on its immediate surroundings, and the change in external parameters corresponds to a displacement x of the center of mass of the system, then the work done by A
            on its surroundings is simply
            W = F·x : (4.9)
            that is, the product of the force and the displacement along the line of action of the force. In a
            general interaction of the system A with its environment there is both heat exchange and work
            performed. We can write
            Q ≡ ∆E + W, (4.10)
            which serves as the general definition of the absorbed heat Q. (Hence, the equivalence sign.) The
            quantity Q is simply the change in the mean energy of the system that is not due to the modification
            of the external parameters. Note that the notion of a quantity of heat has no independent meaning
            apart from Equation (4.10). The mean energy, E, and work performed, W, are both physical
            quantities that can be determined experimentally, whereas Q is merely a derived quantity.
            4.4 Quasi-Static Processes
            Consider the special case of an interaction of the system A with its surroundings that is carried
            out so slowly that A remains arbitrarily close to equilibrium at all times. Such a process is said
            to be quasi-static for the system A. In practice, a quasi-static process must be carried out on a
            timescale that is much longer than the relaxation time of the system. Recall that the relaxation
            time is the typical timescale for the system to return to equilibrium after being suddenly disturbed.
            (See Section 3.5.)
            A finite quasi-static change can be built up out of many infinitesimal changes. The infinitesimal
            heat, ¯dQ, absorbed by the system when infinitesimal work, ¯dW, is done on its environment, and its
            average energy changes by dE, is given by
            dQ¯ ≡ dE +dW¯ . (4.11)
            The special symbols ¯dW and ¯dQ are introduced to emphasize that the work done, and the heat
            absorbed, are infinitesimal quantities that do not correspond to the difference between two works
            or two heats. Instead, the work done, and the heat absorbed, depend on the interaction process
            itself. Thus, it makes no sense to talk about the work in the system before and after the process, or
            the difference between these.
            Heat and Work 47
            If the external parameters of the system have the values x1, ··· , xn then the energy of the system
            in a definite microstate, r, can be written
            Er = Er(x1, ··· , xn). (4.12)
            Hence, if the external parameters are changed by infinitesimal amounts, so that xα → xα + dxα for
            α in the range 1 to n, then the corresponding change in the energy of the microstate is
            dEr =
            
            α=1,n
            ∂Er
            ∂xα
            dxα. (4.13)
            The work, ¯dW, done by the system when it remains in this particular state r is [see Equation (4.8)]
            dW¯ =
            
            α=1,n
            Xα r dxα, (4.14)
            where
            Xα r ≡ −
            ∂Er
            ∂xα
            (4.15)
            is termed the generalized force (conjugate to the external parameter xα) in the state r. (See Section B.2.) Note that if xα is a displacement then Xα r is an ordinary force.
            Consider, now, an ensemble of systems. Provided that the external parameters of the system
            are changed quasi-statically, the generalized forces Xα r have well-defined mean values that are
            calculable from the distribution of systems in the ensemble characteristic of the instantaneous
            macrostate. The macroscopic work, ¯dW, resulting from an infinitesimal quasi-static change of the
            external parameters is obtained by calculating the decrease in the mean energy resulting from the
            parameter change. Thus,
            dW¯ =
            
            α=1,n
            Xα dxα, (4.16)
            where
            Xα ≡ −
            ∂Er
            ∂xα
            (4.17)
            is the mean generalized force conjugate to xα. The mean value is calculated from the equilibrium
            distribution of systems in the ensemble corresponding to the external parameter values xα. The
            macroscopic work, W, resulting from a finite quasi-static change of external parameters can be
            obtained by integrating Equation (4.16).
            The most well-known example of quasi-static work in thermodynamics is that done by pressure
            when the volume changes. For simplicity, suppose that the volume V is the only external parameter
            of any consequence. The work done in changing the volume from V to V+dV is simply the product
            of the force and the displacement (along the line of action of the force). By definition, the mean
            equilibrium pressure, ¯p, of a given macrostate is equal to the normal force per unit area acting on
            any surface element. Thus, the normal force acting on a surface element dSi is ¯p dSi. Suppose that
            the surface element is subject to a displacement dxi. The work done by the element is ¯p dSi ·dxi.
            The total work done by the system is obtained by summing over all of the surface elements. Thus,
            dW¯ = p dV ¯ , (4.18)
            48 4.5. Exact and Inexact Differentials
            where
            dV =
            
            i
            dSi ·dxi (4.19)
            is the infinitesimal volume change due to the displacement of the surface. It follows from Equations (4.16) and (4.18) that
            p¯ = −∂E
            ∂V . (4.20)
            Thus, the mean pressure is the generalized force conjugate to the volume, V.
            Suppose that a quasi-static process is carried out in which the volume is changed from Vi to
            Vf . In general, the mean pressure, ¯p, is a function of the volume, so ¯p = p¯(V). It follows that the
            macroscopic work done by the system is given by
            Wi f =
             Vf
            Vi
            dW¯ =
             Vf
            Vi
            p¯(V) dV. (4.21)
            This quantity is just the area under the curve in a plot of ¯p(V) versus V.
            4.5 Exact and Inexact Differentials
            In our investigation of heat and work, we have come across various infinitesimal objects, such as
            dE and ¯dW. It is instructive to examine these infinitesimals more closely.
            Consider the purely mathematical problem where F(x, y) is some general function of two independent variables, x and y. Consider the change in F in going from the point (x, y) in the x-y
            plane to the neighboring point (x + dx, y + dy). This is given by
            dF = F(x + dx, y + dy) − F(x, y), (4.22)
            which can also be written
            dF = X(x, y) dx + Y(x, y) dy, (4.23)
            where X = ∂F/∂x and Y = ∂F/∂y. Clearly, dF is simply the infinitesimal difference between two
            adjacent values of the function F. This type of infinitesimal quantity is termed an exact differential
            to distinguish it from another type to be discussed presently. If we move in the x-y plane from an
            initial point i ≡ (xi, yi) to a final point f ≡ (xf , yf) then the corresponding change in F is given by
            ∆F = Ff − Fi =
             f
            i
            dF =
             f
            i
            (X dx + Y dy). (4.24)
            Note that because the difference on the left-hand side depends only on the initial and final points,
            the integral on the right-hand side can only depend on these points as well. In other words, the
            value of the integral is independent of the path taken in going from the initial to the final point.
            This is the distinguishing feature of an exact differential. Consider an integral taken around a
            closed circuit in the x-y plane. In this case, the initial and final points correspond to the same
            Heat and Work 49
            point, so the difference Ff − Fi is clearly zero. It follows that the integral of an exact differential
            over a closed circuit is always zero:
            !
            dF ≡ 0. (4.25)
            Of course, not every infinitesimal quantity is an exact differential. Consider the infinitesimal
            object
            dG¯ ≡ X
            (x, y) dx + Y
            (x, y) dz, (4.26)
            where X and Y are two general functions of x and y. It is easy to test whether or not an infinitesimal quantity is an exact differential. Consider the expression (4.23). It is clear that because
            X = ∂F/∂x and Y = ∂F/∂y then
            ∂X
            ∂y = ∂Y
            ∂x = ∂2F
            ∂x ∂y. (4.27)
            Thus, if
            ∂X
            ∂y 
            ∂Y
            ∂x
            (4.28)
            (as is assumed to be the case), then ¯dG cannot be an exact differential, and is instead termed an
            inexact differential. The special symbol ¯d is used to denote an inexact differential. Consider the
            integral of ¯dG over some path in the x-y plane. In general, it is not true that
             f
            i
            dG¯ =
             f
            i
            (X dx + Y dy) (4.29)
            is independent of the path taken between the initial and final points. This is the distinguishing
            feature of an inexact differential. In particular, the integral of an inexact differential around a
            closed circuit is not necessarily zero, so
            !
            dG¯  0. (4.30)
            Consider, for the moment, the solution of
            dG¯ = 0, (4.31)
            which reduces to the ordinary differential equation
            dy
            dx = −X
            Y . (4.32)
            Because the right-hand side is a known function of x and y, the previous equation defines a definite
            direction (i.e., gradient) at each point in the x-y plane. The solution simply consists of drawing a
            system of curves in the x-y plane such that, at any point, the tangent to the curve is as specified by
            Equation (4.32). This defines a set of curves that can be written σ(x, y) = c, where c is a labeling
            parameter. It follows that, on a particular curve,
            dσ
            dx
            ≡
            ∂σ
            ∂x
            +
            ∂σ
            ∂y
            dy
            dx = 0. (4.33)
            50 4.5. Exact and Inexact Differentials
            The elimination of dy/dx between Equations (4.32) and (4.33) yields
            Y ∂σ
            ∂x = X ∂σ
            ∂y = X Y
            τ , (4.34)
            where τ(x, y) is function of x and y. The previous equation could equally well be written
            X = τ
            ∂σ
            ∂x
            , Y = τ
            ∂σ
            ∂y . (4.35)
            Inserting Equation (4.35) into Equation (4.26) gives
            dG¯ = τ
            
            ∂σ
            ∂x
            dx +
            ∂σ
            ∂y dy
            
            = τ dσ, (4.36)
            or
            dG¯
            τ = dσ. (4.37)
            Thus, dividing the inexact differential ¯dG by τ yields the exact differential dσ. A factor τ that
            possesses this property is termed an integrating factor. Because the previous analysis is quite
            general, it is clear that an inexact differential involving two independent variables always admits of
            an integrating factor. Note, however, this is not generally the case for inexact differentials involving
            more than two variables.
            After this mathematical excursion, let us return to a physical situation of interest. The macrostate
            of a macroscopic system can be specified by the values of the external parameters (e.g., the volume), and the mean energy, E. This, in turn, fixes other parameters, such as the mean pressure, ¯p.
            Alternatively, we can specify the external parameters and the mean pressure, which fixes the mean
            energy. Quantities such as dp¯ and dE are infinitesimal differences between well-defined quantities:
            that is, they are exact differentials. For example, dE = Ef − Ei is just the difference between the
            mean energy of the system in the final macrostate f and the initial macrostate i, in the limit where
            these two states are nearly the same. It follows that if the system is taken from an initial macrostate
            i to any final macrostate f then the mean energy change is given by
            ∆E = Ef − Ei =
             f
            i
            dE. (4.38)
            However, because the mean energy is just a function of the macrostate under consideration, Ef and
            Ei depend only on the initial and final states, respectively. Thus, the integral 
            dE depends only
            on the initial and final states, and not on the particular process used to get between them.
            Consider, now, the infinitesimal work done by the system in going from some initial macrostate
            i to some neighbouring final macrostate f . In general, ¯dW =  Xα dxα is not the difference between
            two numbers referring to the properties of two neighboring macrostates. Instead, it is merely an
            infinitesimal quantity characteristic of the process of going from state i to state f . In other words,
            the work ¯dW is in general an inexact differential. The total work done by the system in going from
            any macrostate i to some other macrostate f can be written as
            Wi f =
             f
            i
            dW¯ , (4.39)
            Heat and Work 51
            where the integral represents the sum of the infinitesimal amounts of work ¯dW performed at each
            stage of the process. In general, the value of the integral does depend on the particular process
            used in going from macrostate i to macrostate f .
            Recall that, in going from macrostate i to macrostate f , the change in energy, ∆E, does not
            depend on the process used, whereas the work done, W, in general, does. Thus, it follows from the
            first law of thermodynamics, Equation (4.10), that the heat absorbed, Q, in general, also depends
            on the process used. It follows that
            dQ¯ ≡ dE +dW¯ (4.40)
            is an inexact differential. However, by analogy with the mathematical example discussed previously, there must exist some integrating factor, T (say), that converts the inexact differential ¯dQ
            into an exact differential. So,
            dQ¯
            T
            ≡ dS. (4.41)
            It will be interesting to discover the physical quantities that correspond to the functions T and S .
            (See Section 5.5.)
            Suppose that the system is thermally insulated, so that ¯dQ = 0. In this case, the first law of
            thermodynamics implies that
            Wi f = −∆E. (4.42)
            Thus, in this special case, the work done depends only on the energy difference between the initial
            and final states, and is independent of the process. In fact, when Clausius first formulated the first
            law of thermodynamics, in 1850, he wrote:
            If a thermally isolated system is brought from some initial to some final state then the
            work done by the system is independent of the process used.
            If the external parameters of the system are kept fixed, so that no work is done, then ¯dW = 0,
            Equation (4.11) reduces to
            dQ¯ = dE, (4.43)
            and ¯dQ becomes an exact differential. The amount of heat, Q, absorbed in going from one
            macrostate to another depends only on the mean energy difference between them, and is independent of the process used to effect the change. In this situation, heat is a conserved quantity, and
            acts very much like the invisible indestructible fluid of Lavoisier’s calorific theory.
            Exercises

            5 Statistical Thermodynamics
            5.1 Introduction
            Let us briefly review the material that we have covered in this course so far. We started off by
            studying the mathematics of probability. We then used probabilistic reasoning to analyze the dynamics of many-particle systems, a subject area known as statistical mechanics. Next, we explored
            the physics of heat and work, the study of which is termed thermodynamics. The final step in our
            investigation is to combine statistical mechanics with thermodynamics. In other words, to investigate heat and work via statistical arguments. This discipline is called statistical thermodynamics,
            the study of which will form the central subject matter of this course. This chapter constitutes an
            introduction to the fundamental concepts of statistical thermodynamics. The remaining chapters
            will then explore the various applications of these concepts.
            5.2 Thermal Interaction Between Macrosystems
            Let us begin our investigation of statistical thermodynamics by examining a purely thermal interaction between two macroscopic systems, A and A
            , from a microscopic point of view. Suppose
            that the energies of these two systems are E and E
            , respectively. The external parameters are held
            fixed, so that A and A cannot do work on one another. However, we shall assume that the systems
            are free to exchange heat energy (i.e., they are in thermal contact). It is convenient to divide the
            energy scale into small subdivisions of width δE. The number of microstates of A consistent with
            a macrostate in which the energy lies in the range E to E + δE is denoted Ω(E). Likewise, the
            number of microstates of A consistent with a macrostate in which the energy lies between E and
            E + δE is denoted Ω
            (E
            ).
            The combined system A(0) = A + A is assumed to be isolated (i.e., it neither does work on, nor
            exchanges heat with, its surroundings). It follows from the first law of thermodynamics that the
            total energy, E (0), is constant. When speaking of thermal contact between two distinct systems,
            we usually assume that the mutual interaction is sufficiently weak for the energies to be additive.
            Thus,
            E + E  E (0) = constant. (5.1)
            Of course, in the limit of zero interaction, the energies are strictly additive. However, a small
            residual interaction is always required to enable the two systems to exchange heat energy, and,
            thereby, eventually reach thermal equilibrium. (See Section 3.4.) In fact, if the interaction between
            A and A is too strong for the energies to be additive then it makes little sense to consider each
            system in isolation, because the presence of one system clearly strongly perturbs the other, and
            vice versa. In this case, the smallest system that can realistically be examined in isolation is A(0).
            According to Equation (5.1), if the energy of A lies in the range E to E + δE then the energy
            of A must lie between E (0) − E − δE and E (0) − E. Thus, the number of microstates accessible
            to each system is given by Ω(E) and Ω
            (E (0) − E), respectively. Because every possible state of A
            54 5.2. Thermal Interaction Between Macrosystems
            can be combined with every possible state of A to form a distinct microstate, the total number of
            distinct states accessible to A(0) when the energy of A lies in the range E to E + δE is
            Ω(0) = Ω(E) Ω
            (E (0) − E). (5.2)
            Consider an ensemble of pairs of thermally interacting systems, A and A
            , that are left undisturbed for many relaxation times, so that they can attain thermal equilibrium. The principle of
            equal a priori probabilities is applicable to this situation. (See Section 3.3.) According to this
            principle, the probability of occurrence of a given macrostate is proportional to the number of
            accessible microstates, because all microstates are equally likely. Thus, the probability that the
            system A has an energy lying in the range E to E + δE can be written
            P(E) = C Ω(E) Ω
            (E (0) − E), (5.3)
            where C is a constant that is independent of E.
            We know, from Section 3.8, that the typical variation of the number of accessible states with
            energy is of the form
            Ω ∝ E f
            , (5.4)
            where f is the number of degrees of freedom. For a macroscopic system, f is an exceedingly
            large number. It follows that the probability, P(E), in Equation (5.3) is the product of an extremely
            rapidly increasing function of E, and an extremely rapidly decreasing function of E. Hence, we
            would expect the probability to exhibit a very pronounced maximum at some particular value of
            the energy.
            Let us Taylor expand the logarithm of P(E) in the vicinity of its maximum value, which is
            assumed to occur at E = E˜. We expand the relatively slowly-varying logarithm, rather than the
            function itself, because the latter varies so rapidly with the energy that the radius of convergence of
            its Taylor series is too small for this expansion to be of any practical use. The expansion of ln Ω(E)
            yields
            ln Ω(E) = ln Ω(E˜) + β(E˜) η − 1
            2 λ(E˜) η 2 + ··· , (5.5)
            where
            η = E − E˜, (5.6)
            β = ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E , (5.7)
            λ = −∂2 ln Ω
            ∂E 2 = − ∂β
            ∂E . (5.8)
            Now, because E = E (0) − E, we have
            E − E˜ = −(E − E˜) = −η. (5.9)
            Here, E˜ = E (0) − E˜. It follows that
            ln Ω
            (E
            ) = ln Ω
            (E˜
            ) + β
            (E˜
            ) (−η) − 1
            2 λ
            (E˜
            ) (−η) 2 + ··· , (5.10)
            Statistical Thermodynamics 55
            where β and λ are defined in an analogous manner to the parameters β and λ. Equations (5.5) and
            (5.10) can be combined to give
            ln [Ω(E) Ω
            (E
            )] = ln [Ω(E˜) Ω
            (E˜
            )] + [β(E˜) − β
            (E˜
            )] η − 1
            2 [λ(E˜) + λ
            (E˜
            )] η 2 + ··· . (5.11)
            At the maximum of ln [Ω(E) Ω
            (E
            )], the linear term in the Taylor expansion must vanish, so
            β(E˜) = β
            (E˜
            ), (5.12)
            which enables us to determine E˜. It follows that
            ln P(E) = ln P(E˜) − 1
            2 λ0 η 2
            , (5.13)
            or
            P(E) = P(E˜) exp 
            −1
            2 λ0 (E − E˜) 2
            
            , (5.14)
            where
            λ0 = λ(E˜) + λ
            (E˜
            ). (5.15)
            Now, the parameter λ0 must be positive, otherwise the probability P(E) does not exhibit a pronounced maximum value. That is, the combined system, A(0), does not possess a well-defined
            equilibrium state as, physically, we know it must. It is clear that λ(E˜) must also be positive, because we could always choose for A a system with a negligible contribution to λ0, in which case
            the constraint λ0 > 0 would effectively correspond to λ(E˜) > 0. [A similar argument can be used to
            show that λ
            (E˜
            ) must be positive.] The same conclusion also follows from the estimate Ω ∝ E f
            ,
            which implies that
            λ(E˜) ∼ f
            E˜ 2
            > 0. (5.16)
            According to Equation (5.14), the probability distribution function, P(E), is Gaussian. (See
            Section 2.9.) This is hardly surprising, because the central limit theorem ensures that the probability distribution for any macroscopic variable, such as E, is Gaussian in nature. (See Section 2.10.)
            It follows that the mean value of E corresponds to the situation of maximum probability (i.e., the
            peak of the Gaussian curve), so that
            E = E˜. (5.17)
            The standard deviation of the distribution is
            ∆∗
            E = λ −1/2
            0 ∼ E
            f
            , (5.18)
            where use has been made of Equation (5.16) (assuming that system A makes the dominant contribution to λ0). It follows that the fractional width of the probability distribution function is given
            by
            ∆∗E
            E ∼ 1
            f
            . (5.19)
            56 5.3. Temperature
            Hence, if A contains 1 mole of particles then f ∼ NA  1024, and ∆∗E/E ∼ 10 −12. Clearly, the
            probability distribution for E has an exceedingly sharp maximum. Experimental measurements of
            this energy will almost always yield the mean value, and the underlying statistical nature of the
            distribution may not be apparent.
            5.3 Temperature
            Suppose that the systems A and A are initially thermally isolated from one another, with respective
            energies Ei and E
            i
            . (Because the energy of an isolated system cannot fluctuate, we do not have to
            bother with mean energies here.) If the two systems are subsequently placed in thermal contact, so
            that they are free to exchange heat energy, then, in general, the resulting state is an extremely improbable one [i.e., P(Ei) is much less than the peak probability]. The configuration will, therefore,
            tend to evolve in time until the two systems attain final mean energies, E f and E
            
            f , which are such
            that
            βf = β
            f , (5.20)
            where βf ≡ β(Ef) and β
            f ≡ β
            (E
            
            f). This corresponds to the state of maximum probability. (See
            Section 5.2.) In the special case where the initial energies, Ei and E
            i
            , lie very close to the final mean
            energies, Ef and E
            
            f , respectively, there is no change in the two systems when they are brought into
            thermal contact, because the initial state already corresponds to a state of maximum probability.
            It follows from energy conservation that
            Ef + E
            
            f = Ei + E
            i . (5.21)
            The mean energy change in each system is simply the net heat absorbed, so that
            Q ≡ Ef − Ei, (5.22)
            Q ≡ E
            
            f − E
            i . (5.23)
            The conservation of energy then reduces to
            Q + Q = 0. (5.24)
            In other words, the heat given off by one system is equal to the heat absorbed by the other. (In our
            notation, absorbed heat is positive, and emitted heat is negative.)
            It is clear that if the systems A and A are suddenly brought into thermal contact then they will
            only exchange heat, and evolve towards a new equilibrium state, if the final state is more probable
            than the initial one. In other words, the system will evolve if
            P(E f) > P(Ei), (5.25)
            or
            ln P(E f) > ln P(Ei), (5.26)
            Statistical Thermodynamics 57
            because the logarithm is a monotonic function. The previous inequality can be written
            ln Ω(Ef) + ln Ω
            (E

            (E
            i), (5.27)
            with the aid of Equation (5.3). Taylor expansion to first order yields
            ∂ ln Ω(Ei)
            ∂E (Ef − Ei) +
            ∂ ln Ω
            (E
            i
            )
            ∂E (E
            
            f − E
            i) > 0, (5.28)
            which finally gives
            (βi − β
            i) Q > 0, (5.29)
            where βi ≡ β(Ei), β
            i ≡ β
            (E
            i
            ), and use has been made of Equations (5.22)–(5.24).
            It is clear, from the previous analysis, that the parameter β, defined
            β = ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E , (5.30)
            has the following properties:
            1. If two systems separately in equilibrium have the same value of β then the systems will
            remain in equilibrium when brought into thermal contact with one another.
            2. If two systems separately in equilibrium have different values of β then the systems will
            not remain in equilibrium when brought into thermal contact with one another. Instead, the
            system with the higher value of β will absorb heat from the other system until the two β
            values are the same. [See Equation (5.29).]
            Incidentally, a partial derivative is used in Equation (5.30) because, in a purely thermal interaction,
            the external parameters of the system are held constant as the energy changes.
            Let us define the dimensionless parameter T, such that
            1
            k T
            ≡ β = ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E , (5.31)
            where k is a positive constant having the dimensions of energy. The parameter T is termed the
            thermodynamic temperature, and controls heat flow in much the same manner as a conventional
            temperature. Thus, if two isolated systems in equilibrium possess the same thermodynamic temperature then they will remain in equilibrium when brought into thermal contact. However, if the
            two systems have different thermodynamic temperatures then heat will flow from the system with
            the higher temperature (i.e., the “hotter” system) to the system with the lower temperature, until
            the temperatures of the two systems are the same. In addition, suppose that we have three systems
            A, B, and C. We know that if A and B remain in equilibrium when brought into thermal contact
            then their temperatures are the same, so that TA = TB. Similarly, if B and C remain in equilibrium
            when brought into thermal contact, then TB = TC. But, we can then conclude that TA = TC, so
            systems A and C will also remain in equilibrium when brought into thermal contact. Thus, we
            arrive at the following statement, which is sometimes called the zeroth law of thermodynamics:
            58 5.3. Temperature
            If two systems are separately in thermal equilibrium with a third system then they must
            also be in thermal equilibrium with one another.
            The thermodynamic temperature of a macroscopic body, as defined in Equation (5.31), depends
            only on the rate of change of the number of accessible microstates with the total energy. Thus, it is
            possible to define a thermodynamic temperature for systems with radically different microscopic
            structures (e.g., matter and radiation). The thermodynamic, or absolute, scale of temperature is
            measured in degrees kelvin. The parameter k is chosen to make this temperature scale accord as
            much as possible with more conventional temperature scales. The choice
            k = 1.381 × 10−23 joules/kelvin, (5.32)
            ensures that there are 100 degrees kelvin between the freezing and boiling points of water at atmospheric pressure (the two temperatures are 273.15 K and 373.15 K, respectively). Here, k is known
            as the Boltzmann constant. In fact, the Boltzmann constant is fixed by international convention so
            as to make the triple point of water (i.e., the unique temperature at which the three phases of water
            co-exist in thermal equilibrium) exactly 273.16 K. Note that the zero of the thermodynamic scale,
            the so called absolute zero of temperature, does not correspond to the freezing point of water, but to
            some far more physically significant temperature that we shall discuss presently. (See Section 5.9.)
            The familiar Ω ∝ E f scaling for translational degrees of freedom (see Section 3.8) yields
            k T ∼ E
            f
            , (5.33)
            using Equation (5.31), so k T is a rough measure of the mean energy associated with each degree
            of freedom in the system. In fact, for a classical system (i.e., one in which quantum effects are
            unimportant) it is possible to show that the mean energy associated with each degree of freedom
            is exactly (1/2) k T. This result, which is known as the equipartition theorem, will be discussed in
            more detail later on in this course. (See Section 7.10.)
            The absolute temperature, T, is usually positive, because Ω(E) is ordinarily a very rapidly increasing function of energy. In fact, this is the case for all conventional systems where the kinetic
            energy of the particles is taken into account, because there is no upper bound on the possible energy of the system, and Ω(E) consequently increases roughly like E f
            . It is, however, possible to
            envisage a situation in which we ignore the translational degrees of freedom of a system, and concentrate only on its spin degrees of freedom. In this case, there is an upper bound to the possible
            energy of the system (i.e., all spins lined up anti-parallel to an applied magnetic field). Consequently, the total number of states available to the system is finite. In this situation, the density
            of spin states, Ωspin(E), first increases with increasing energy, as in conventional systems, but then
            reaches a maximum and decreases again. Thus, it is possible to get absolute spin temperatures that
            are negative, as well as positive. (See Exercise 5.2.)
            In Lavoisier’s calorific theory, the basic mechanism that forces heat to spontaneously flow from
            hot to cold bodies is the supposed mutual repulsion of the constituent particles of calorific fluid. In
            statistical mechanics, the explanation is far less contrived. Heat flow occurs because statistical systems tend to evolve towards their most probable states, subject to the imposed physical constraints.
            Statistical Thermodynamics 59
            When two bodies at different temperatures are suddenly placed in thermal contact, the initial state
            corresponds to a spectacularly improbable state of the overall system. For systems containing of
            order 1 mole of particles, the only reasonably probable final equilibrium states are such that the
            two bodies differ in temperature by less than 1 part in 1012. Thus, the evolution of the system
            towards these final states (i.e., towards thermal equilibrium) is effectively driven by probability.
            5.4 Mechanical Interaction Between Macrosystems
            Let us now examine a purely mechanical interaction between macrostates, where one or more of
            the external parameters is modified, but there is no exchange of heat energy. Consider, for the sake
            of simplicity, a situation where only one external parameter, x, of the system is free to vary. In
            general, the number of microstates accessible to the system when the overall energy lies between
            E and E + δE depends on the particular value of x, so we can write Ω ≡ Ω(E, x).
            When x is changed by the amount dx, the energy Er(x) of a given microstate r changes by
            (∂Er/∂x) dx. The number of states, σ(E, x), whose energy is changed from a value less than E
            to a value greater than E, when the parameter changes from x to x + dx, is given by the number
            of microstates per unit energy range multiplied by the average shift in energy of the microstates.
            Hence,
            σ(E, x) = Ω(E, x)
            δE
            ∂Er
            ∂x
            dx, (5.34)
            where the mean value of ∂Er/∂x is taken over all accessible microstates (i.e., all states for which
            the energy lies between E and E + δE, and the external parameter takes the value x). The previous
            equation can also be written
            σ(E, x) = −Ω(E, x)
            δE
            X dx, (5.35)
            where
            X(E, x) = −∂Er
            ∂x
            (5.36)
            is the mean generalized force conjugate to the external parameter x. (See Section 4.4.)
            Consider the total number of microstates whose energies lies between E and E +δE. When the
            external parameter changes from x to x + dx, the number of states in this energy range changes by
            (∂Ω/∂x) dx. This change is due to the difference between the number of states that enter the range
            because their energy is changed from a value less than E to one greater than E, and the number
            that leave because their energy is changed from a value less than E +δE to one greater than E +δE.
            In symbols,
            ∂Ω(E, x)
            ∂x
            dx = σ(E) − σ(E + δE)  −∂σ
            ∂E
            δE, (5.37)
            which yields
            ∂Ω
            ∂x = ∂(Ω X)
            ∂E , (5.38)
            60 5.5. General Interaction Between Macrosystems
            where use has been made of Equation (5.35). Dividing both sides by Ω gives
            ∂ ln Ω
            ∂x = ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E
            X +
            ∂X
            ∂E. (5.39)
            However, according to the usual estimate Ω ∝ E f (see Section 3.8), the first term on the right-hand
            side is of order (f /E) X, whereas the second term is only of order X/E. Clearly, for a macroscopic
            system with many degrees of freedom, the second term is utterly negligible, so we have
            ∂ ln Ω
            ∂x = ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E
            X = β X, (5.40)
            where use has been made of Equation (5.30).
            When there are several external parameters, x1, ··· , xn, so that Ω ≡ Ω(E, x1, ··· , xn), the previous derivation is valid for each parameter taken in isolation. Thus,
            ∂ ln Ω
            ∂xα
            = β Xα, (5.41)
            where Xα is the mean generalized force conjugate to the parameter xα. (See Section B.2.)
            5.5 General Interaction Between Macrosystems
            Consider two systems, A and A
            , that can interact by exchanging heat energy and doing work on one
            another. Let the system A have energy E, and adjustable external parameters x1, ··· , xn. Likewise,
            let the system A have energy E
            , and adjustable external parameters x
            1, ··· , x
            n. The combined
            system A(0) = A + A is assumed to be isolated. It follows from the first law of thermodynamics
            that
            E + E = E (0) = constant. (5.42)
            Thus, the energy E of system A is determined once the energy E of system A is given, and vice
            versa. In fact, E could be regarded as a function of E. Furthermore, if the two systems can interact
            mechanically then, in general, the parameters x are some function of the parameters x. As a simple
            example, if the two systems are separated by a movable partition, in an enclosure of fixed volume
            V (0), then
            V + V = V (0) = constant, (5.43)
            where V and V are the volumes of systems A and A
            , respectively.
            The total number of microstates accessible to A(0) is clearly a function of E, and the parameters
            xα (where α runs from 1 to n), so Ω(0) ≡ Ω(0)(E, x1, ··· , xn). We have already demonstrated (in
            Section 5.2) that Ω(0) exhibits a very pronounced maximum at one particular value of the energy,
            E = E˜, when E is varied but the external parameters are held constant. This behavior comes about
            because of the very strong,
            Ω ∝ E f
            , (5.44)
            Statistical Thermodynamics 61
            increase in the number of accessible microstates of A (or A
            ) with energy. However, according
            to Section 3.8, the number of accessible microstates exhibits a similar strong increase with the
            volume, which is a typical external parameter, so that
            Ω ∝ V f
            . (5.45)
            It follows that the variation of Ω(0) with a typical parameter, xα, when all the other parameters
            and the energy are held constant, also exhibits a very sharp maximum at some particular value,
            xα = x˜α. The equilibrium situation corresponds to the configuration of maximum probability, in
            which virtually all systems A(0) in the ensemble have values of E and xα very close to E˜ and ˜xα,
            respectively. The mean values of these quantities are thus given by E = E˜ and ¯xα = x˜α.
            Consider a quasi-static process in which the system A is brought from an equilibrium state
            described by E and ¯xα to an infinitesimally different equilibrium state described by E + dE and
            x¯α + dx¯α. Let us calculate the resultant change in the number of microstates accessible to A.
            Because Ω ≡ Ω(E, x1, ··· , xn), the change in ln Ω follows from standard mathematics:
            d ln Ω = ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E
            dE +

            ∂ ln Ω
            ∂xα
            dx¯α. (5.46)
            However, we have previously demonstrated that
            β = ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E , β Xα = ∂ ln Ω
            ∂xα
            (5.47)
            [in Equations (5.30) and (5.41), respectively], so Equation (5.46) can be written
            d ln Ω = β
            

            Xα dx¯α
            
             . (5.48)
            Note that the temperature parameter, β, and the mean conjugate forces, Xα, are only well defined
            for equilibrium states. This is why we are only considering quasi-static changes in which the two
            systems are always arbitrarily close to equilibrium.
            Let us rewrite Equation (5.48) in terms of the thermodynamic temperature, T, using the relation
            β ≡ 1/k T. We obtain
            dS =
            

            T, (5.49)
            where
            S = k ln Ω. (5.50)
            Equation (5.49) is a differential relation that enables us to calculate the quantity S as a function
            of the mean energy, E, and the mean external parameters, ¯xα, assuming that we can calculate the
            temperature, T, and mean conjugate forces, Xα, for each equilibrium state. The function S (E, x¯α) is
            termed the entropy of system A. The word entropy is derived from the Greek entrop¯e, which means
            “a turning towards” or ”tendency.” The reason for this etymology will become apparent presently.
            62 5.6. Entropy
            It can be seen from Equation (5.50) that the entropy is merely a parameterization of the number of
            accessible microstates. Hence, according to statistical mechanics, S (E, x¯α) is essentially a measure
            of the relative probability of a state characterized by values of the mean energy and mean external
            parameters E and ¯xα, respectively.
            According to Equation (4.16), the net amount of work performed during a quasi-static change
            is given by
            dW¯ =
            
            α
            Xα dx¯α. (5.51)
            It follows from Equation (5.49) that
            dS = dE +dW¯
            T =dQ¯
            T . (5.52)
            Thus, the thermodynamic temperature, T, is the integrating factor for the first law of thermodynamics,
            dQ¯ = dE +dW¯ , (5.53)
            which converts the inexact differential ¯dQ into the exact differential dS . (See Section 4.5.) It
            follows that the entropy difference between any two macrostates i and f can be written
            S f − S i =
             f
            i
            dS =
             f
            i
            dQ¯
            T , (5.54)
            where the integral is evaluated for any process through which the system is brought quasi-statically
            via a sequence of near-equilibrium configurations from its initial to its final macrostate. The process has to be quasi-static because the temperature, T, which appears in the integrand, is only well
            defined for an equilibrium state. Because the left-hand side of the previous equation only depends
            on the initial and final states, it follows that the integral on the right-hand side is independent of the
            particular sequence of quasi-static changes used to get from i to f . Thus,  f
            i dQ¯ /T is independent
            of the process (provided that it is quasi-static).
            All of the concepts that we have encountered up to now in this course, such as temperature, heat,
            energy, volume, pressure, et cetera, have been fairly familiar to us from other branches of physics.
            However, entropy, which turns out to be of crucial importance in thermodynamics, is something
            quite new. Let us consider the following questions. What does the entropy of a thermodynamic
            system actually signify? What use is the concept of entropy?
            5.6 Entropy
            Consider an isolated system whose energy is known to lie in a narrow range. Let Ω be the number
            of accessible microstates. According to the principle of equal a priori probabilities, the system is
            equally likely to be found in any one of these states when it is in thermal equilibrium. The accessible states are just that set of microstates that are consistent with the macroscopic constraints
            imposed on the system. These constraints can usually be quantified by specifying the values of
            some parameters, y1, ··· , yn, that characterize the macrostate. Note that these parameters are not

            necessarily external in nature. For example, we could specify either the volume (an external parameter) or the mean pressure (the mean force conjugate to the volume). The number of accessible
            states is clearly a function of the chosen parameters, so we can write Ω ≡ Ω(y1, ··· , yn) for the
            number of microstates consistent with a macrostate in which the general parameter yα lies in the
            range yα to yα + dyα.
            Suppose that we start from a system in thermal equilibrium. According to statistical mechanics,
            each of the Ωi, say, accessible states are equally likely. Let us now remove, or relax, some of the
            constraints imposed on the system. Clearly, all of the microstates formally accessible to the system
            are still accessible, but many additional states will, in general, become accessible. Thus, removing
            or relaxing constraints can only have the effect of increasing, or possibly leaving unchanged, the
            number of microstates accessible to the system. If the final number of accessible states is Ωf then
            we can write
            Ωf ≥ Ωi. (5.55)
            Immediately after the constraints are relaxed, the systems in the ensemble are not in any of the
            microstates from which they were previously excluded. So, the systems only occupy a fraction
            Pi = Ωi
            Ωf
            (5.56)
            of the Ωf states now accessible to them. This is clearly not a equilibrium situation. Indeed, if
            Ωf 
             Ωi then the configuration in which the systems are only distributed over the original Ωi states
            is an extremely unlikely one. In fact, its probability of occurrence is given by Equation (5.56).
            According to the H-theorem (see Section 3.4), the ensemble will evolve in time until a more
            probable final state is reached in which the systems are evenly distributed over the Ωf available
            states.
            As a simple example, consider a system consisting of a box divided into two regions of equal
            volume. Suppose that, initially, one region is filled with gas, and the other is empty. The constraint
            imposed on the system is, thus, that the coordinates of all of the gas molecules must lie within
            the filled region. In other words, the volume accessible to the system is V = Vi, where Vi is
            half the volume of the box. The constraints imposed on the system can be relaxed by removing
            the partition, and allowing gas to flow into both regions. The volume accessible to the gas is
            now V = Vf = 2 Vi. Immediately after the partition is removed, the system is in an extremely
            improbable state. We know, from Section 3.8, that, at constant energy, the variation of the number
            of accessible states of an ideal gas with the volume is
            Ω ∝ V N, (5.57)
            where N is the number of particles. Thus, the probability of observing the state immediately after
            the partition is removed in an ensemble of equilibrium systems with volume V = Vf is
            Pi = Ωi
            Ωf
            =
            
            Vi
            Vf
            N
            =
            
            1
            2
            N
            . (5.58)
            If the box contains of order 1 mole of molecules then N ∼ 1024, and this probability is fantastically
            small:
            Pi ∼ exp 
            −1024
            . (5.59)
            64 5.6. Entropy
            Clearly, the system will evolve towards a more probable state.
            This discussion can also be phrased in terms of the parameters, y1, ··· , yn, of the system. Suppose that a constraint is removed. For instance, one of the parameters, y, say, which originally had
            the value y = yi, is now allowed to vary. According to statistical mechanics, all states accessible
            to the system are equally likely. So, the probability P(y) of finding the system in equilibrium with
            the parameter in the range y to y + δy is proportional to the number of microstates in this interval:
            that is,
            P(y) ∝ Ω(y). (5.60)
            Usually, Ω(y) has a very pronounced maximum at some particular value ˜y. (See Section 5.2.) This
            means that practically all systems in the final equilibrium ensemble have values of y close to ˜y.
            Thus, if yi  y˜, initially, then the parameter y will change until it attains a final value close to ˜y,
            where Ω is maximum. This discussion can be summed up in a single phrase:
            If some of the constraints of an isolated system are removed then the parameters of the
            system tend to readjust themselves in such a way that
            Ω(y1, ··· , yn) → maximum.
            Suppose that the final equilibrium state has been reached, so that the systems in the ensemble
            are uniformly distributed over the Ωf accessible final states. If the original constraints are reimposed then the systems in the ensemble still occupy these Ωf states with equal probability. Thus,
            if Ωf > Ωi then simply restoring the constraints does not restore the initial situation. Once the systems are randomly distributed over the Ωf states, they cannot be expected to spontaneously move
            out of some of these states, and occupy a more restricted class of states, merely in response to the
            reimposition of a constraint. The initial condition can also not be restored by removing further
            constraints. This could only lead to even more states becoming accessible to the system.
            Suppose that a process occurs in which an isolated system goes from some initial configuration
            to some final configuration. If the final configuration is such that the imposition or removal of
            constraints cannot by itself restore the initial condition then the process is deemed irreversible.
            On the other hand, if it is such that the imposition or removal of constraints can restore the initial
            condition then the process is deemed reversible. From what we have already said, an irreversible
            process is clearly one in which the removal of constraints leads to a situation where Ωf > Ωi. A
            reversible process corresponds to the special case where the removal of constraints does not change
            the number of accessible states, so that Ωf = Ωi. In this situation, the systems remain distributed
            with equal probability over these states irrespective of whether the constraints are imposed or not.
            Our microscopic definition of irreversibility is in accordance with the macroscopic definition
            discussed in Section 3.6. Recall that, on a macroscopic level, an irreversible process is one that
            “looks unphysical” when viewed in reverse. On a microscopic level, it is clearly plausible that a
            system should spontaneously evolve from an improbable to a probable configuration in response
            to the relaxation of some constraint. However, it is quite manifestly implausible that a system
            should ever spontaneously evolve from a probable to an improbable configuration. Let us consider
            our example again. If a gas is initially restricted to one half of a box, via a partition, then the
            flow of gas from one side of the box to the other when the partition is removed is an irreversible
            Statistical Thermodynamics 65
            process. This process is irreversible on a microscopic level because the initial configuration cannot
            be recovered by simply replacing the partition. It is irreversible on a macroscopic level because it
            is obviously unphysical for the molecules of a gas to spontaneously distribute themselves in such
            a manner that they only occupy half of the available volume.
            It is actually possible to quantify irreversibility. In other words, in addition to stating that
            a given process is irreversible, we can also give some indication of how irreversible it is. The
            parameter that measures irreversibility is the number of accessible states, Ω. Thus, if Ω for an
            isolated system spontaneously increases then the process is irreversible, the degree of irreversibility
            being proportional to the amount of the increase. If Ω stays the same then the process is reversible.
            Of course, it is unphysical for Ω to ever spontaneously decrease. In symbols, we can write
            Ωf − Ωi ≡ ∆Ω ≥ 0, (5.61)
            for any physical process operating on an isolated system. In practice, Ω itself is a rather unwieldy
            parameter with which to measure irreversibility. For instance, in the previous example, where an
            ideal gas doubles in volume (at constant energy) due to the removal of a partition, the fractional
            increase in Ω is
            Ωf
            Ωi
             102 ν×1023
            , (5.62)
            where ν is the number of moles. This is an extremely large number. It is far more convenient to
            measure irreversibility in terms of ln Ω. If Equation (5.61) is true then it is certainly also true that
            ln Ωf − ln Ωi ≡ ∆ ln Ω ≥ 0 (5.63)
            for any physical process operating on an isolated system. The increase in ln Ω when an ideal gas
            doubles in volume (at constant energy) is
            ln Ωf − ln Ωi = ν NA ln 2, (5.64)
            where NA = 6 × 1023. This is a far more manageable number. Because we usually deal with
            particles by the mole in laboratory physics, it makes sense to pre-multiply our measure of irreversibility by a number of order 1/NA. For historical reasons, the number that is generally used for
            this purpose is the Boltzmann constant, k, which can be written
            k = R
            NA
            joules/kelvin, (5.65)
            where
            R = 8.3143 joules/kelvin/mole (5.66)
            is the ideal gas constant that appears in the well-known equation of state for an ideal gas, P V =
            ν R T. Thus, the final form for our measure of irreversibility is
            S = k ln Ω. (5.67)
            66 5.6. Entropy
            This quantity is termed “entropy”, and is measured in joules per degree kelvin. The increase in
            entropy when an ideal gas doubles in volume (at constant energy) is
            S f − S i = ν R ln 2, (5.68)
            which is order unity for laboratory-scale systems (i.e., those containing about one mole of particles). The essential irreversibility of macroscopic phenomena can be summed up as follows:
            S f − S i ≡ ∆S ≥ 0, (5.69)
            for a process acting on an isolated system. [This formula is equivalent to Equations (5.61) and
            (5.63).] Thus:
            The entropy of an isolated system tends to increase with time, and can never decrease.
            This proposition is known as the second law of thermodynamics.
            One way of thinking of the number of accessible states, Ω, is that it is a measure of the disorder
            associated with a macrostate. For a system exhibiting a high degree of order, we would expect a
            strong correlation between the motions of the individual particles. For instance, in a fluid there
            might be a strong tendency for the particles to move in one particular direction, giving rise to an
            ordered flow of the system in that direction. On the other hand, for a system exhibiting a low
            degree of order, we expect far less correlation between the motions of individual particles. It
            follows that, all other things being equal, an ordered system is more constrained than a disordered
            system, because the former is excluded from microstates in which there is not a strong correlation
            between individual particle motions, whereas the latter is not. Another way of saying this is that
            an ordered system has less accessible microstates than a corresponding disordered system. Thus,
            entropy is effectively a measure of the disorder in a system (the disorder increases with increasing
            S ). With this interpretation, the second law of thermodynamics reduces to the statement that
            isolated systems tend to become more disordered with time, and can never become more ordered.
            Note that the second law of thermodynamics only applies to isolated systems. The entropy
            of a non-isolated system can decrease. For instance, if a gas expands (at constant energy) to
            twice its initial volume after the removal of a partition, we can subsequently recompress the gas
            to its original volume. The energy of the gas will increase because of the work done on it during
            compression, but if we absorb some heat from the gas then we can restore it to its initial state.
            Clearly, in restoring the gas to its original state, we have restored its original entropy. This appears
            to violate the second law of thermodynamics, because the entropy should have increased in what
            is obviously an irreversible process. However, if we consider a new system consisting of the gas
            plus the compression and heat absorption machinery then it is still true that the entropy of this
            system (which is assumed to be isolated) must increase in time. Thus, the entropy of the gas is
            only kept the same at the expense of increasing the entropy of the rest of the system, and the total
            entropy is increased. If we consider the system of everything in the universe, which is certainly
            an isolated system because there is nothing outside it with which it could interact, then the second
            law of thermodynamics becomes:
            The disorder of the universe tends to increase with time, and can never decrease.
            Statistical Thermodynamics 67
            5.7 Properties of Entropy
            Entropy, as we have defined it, has some dependence on the resolution, δE, to which the energy of
            macrostates is measured. Recall that Ω(E) is the number of accessible microstates with energy in
            the range E to E + δE. Suppose that we choose a new resolution δ∗E, and define a new density of
            states, Ω∗
            (E), which is the number of states with energy in the range E to E + δ∗E. It can easily be
            seen that
            Ω∗
            (E) = δ∗E
            δE
            Ω(E). (5.70)
            It follows that the new entropy, S ∗ = k ln Ω∗, is related to the previous entropy S = k ln Ω via
            S ∗ = S + k ln 
            δ∗E
            δE
            
            . (5.71)
            Now, our usual estimate that Ω ∼ E f (see Section 3.8) gives S ∼ k f , where f is the number of
            degrees of freedom. It follows that even if δ∗E were to differ from δE by of order f (i.e., twenty
            four orders of magnitude), which is virtually inconceivable, the second term on the right-hand side
            of the previous equation is still only of order k ln f , which is utterly negligible compared to k f . It
            follows that
            S ∗ = S (5.72)
            to an excellent approximation, so our definition of entropy is completely insensitive to the resolution to which we measure energy (or any other macroscopic parameter).
            Note that, like the temperature, the entropy of a macrostate is only well defined if the macrostate
            is in equilibrium. The crucial point is that it only makes sense to talk about the number of accessible
            states if the systems in the ensemble are given sufficient time to thoroughly explore all of the
            possible microstates consistent with the known macroscopic constraints. In other words, we can
            only be sure that a given microstate is inaccessible when the systems in the ensemble have had
            ample opportunity to move into it, and yet have not done so. For an equilibrium state, the entropy
            is just as well defined as more familiar quantities such as the temperature and the mean pressure.
            Consider, again, two systems, A and A
            , that are in thermal contact, but can do no work on one
            another. (See Section 5.2.) Let E and E be the energies of the two systems, and Ω(E) and Ω
            (E
            )
            the respective densities of states. Furthermore, let E (0) be the conserved energy of the system as a
            whole, and Ω(0) the corresponding density of states. We have from Equation (5.2) that
            Ω(0)(E) = Ω(E) Ω
            (E
            ), (5.73)
            where E = E (0) − E. In other words, the number of states accessible to the whole system is the
            product of the numbers of states accessible to each subsystem, because every microstate of A can
            be combined with every microstate of A to form a distinct microstate of the whole system. We
            know, from Section 5.2, that in equilibrium the mean energy of A takes the value E = E˜ for which
            Ω(0)(E) is maximum, and the temperatures of A and A are equal. The distribution of E around the
            mean value is of order ∆∗E = E˜/
             f , where f is the number of degrees of freedom. It follows that
            68 5.8. Uses of Entropy
            the total number of accessible microstates is approximately the number of states which lie within
            ∆∗E of E˜. Thus,
            Ω(0)
            tot  Ω(0)(E˜)
            δE
            ∆∗
            E. (5.74)
            The entropy of the whole system is given by
            S (0) = k ln Ω(0)
            tot = k ln Ω(0)(E˜) + k ln 
            ∆∗E
            δE
            
            . (5.75)
            According to our usual estimate, Ω ∼ E f (see Section 3.8), the first term on the right-hand side
            of the previous equation is of order k f , whereas the second term is of order k ln(E˜/
            f δE). Any
            reasonable choice for the energy subdivision, δE, should be greater than E˜/ f , otherwise there
            would be less than one microstate per subdivision. It follows that the second term is less than, or
            of order, k ln f , which is utterly negligible compared to k f . Thus,
            S (0) = k ln Ω(0)(E˜) = k ln[Ω(E˜) Ω(E˜
            )] = k ln Ω(E˜) + k ln Ω
            (E˜
            ) (5.76)
            to an excellent approximation, giving
            S (0) = S (E˜) + S 
            (E˜
            ). (5.77)
            It can be seen that the probability distribution for Ω(0)(E) is so strongly peaked around its maximum
            value that, for the purpose of calculating the entropy, the total number of states is equal to the
            maximum number of states [i.e., Ω(0)
            tot ∼ Ω(0)(E˜)]. One consequence of this is that entropy possesses
            the simple additive property illustrated in Equation (5.77). Thus, the total entropy of two thermally
            interacting systems in equilibrium is the sum of the entropies of each system taken in isolation.
            5.8 Uses of Entropy
            We have defined a new function called entropy, denoted S , that parameterizes the amount of disorder in a macroscopic system. The entropy of an equilibrium macrostate is related to the number
            of accessible microstates, Ω, via
            S = k ln Ω. (5.78)
            On a macroscopic level, the increase in entropy due to a quasi-static change in which an infinitesimal amount of heat, ¯dQ, is absorbed by the system is given by
            dS =dQ¯
            T , (5.79)
            where T is the absolute temperature of the system. The second law of thermodynamics states that
            the entropy of an isolated system can never spontaneously decrease. Let us now briefly examine
            some consequences of these results.
            Consider two bodies, A and A
            , that are in thermal contact, but can do no work on one another.
            We know what is supposed to happen in this situation. Heat flows from the hotter to the colder
            Statistical Thermodynamics 69
            of the two bodies until their temperatures become the same. Consider a quasi-static exchange of
            heat between the two bodies. According to the first law of thermodynamics, if an infinitesimal
            amount of heat, ¯dQ, is absorbed by A then infinitesimal heat, ¯dQ = −dQ¯ , is absorbed by A
            . The
            increase in the entropy of system A is dS = dQ¯ /T, and the corresponding increase in the entropy
            of A is dS  = dQ¯ 
            /T
            . Here, T and T are the temperatures of the two systems, respectively. Note
            that ¯dQ is assumed to the sufficiently small that the heat transfer does not substantially modify the
            temperatures of either system. The change in entropy of the whole system is
            dS (0) = dS + dS  =
            
            1
            T − 1
            T
            
            dQ¯ . (5.80)
            This change must be positive or zero, according to the second law of thermodynamics, so dS (0) ≥ 0.
            It follows that ¯dQ is positive (i.e., heat flows from A to A) when T > T, and vice versa. The
            spontaneous flow of heat only ceases when T = T
            . Thus, the direction of spontaneous heat
            flow is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Note that the spontaneous flow of
            heat between bodies at different temperatures is always an irreversible process that increases the
            entropy, or disorder, of the universe.
            Consider, now, the slightly more complicated situation in which the two systems can exchange
            heat, and also do work on one another via a movable partition. Suppose that the total volume is
            invariant, so that
            V (0) = V + V = constant, (5.81)
            where V and V are the volumes of A and A
            , respectively. Consider a quasi-static change in which
            system A absorbs an infinitesimal amount of heat, ¯dQ, and its volume simultaneously increases by
            an infinitesimal amount, dV. The infinitesimal amount of work done by system A is ¯dW = p dV ¯
            (see Section 4.4), where ¯p is the mean pressure of A. According to the first law of thermodynamics,
            dQ¯ = dE +dW¯ = dE + p dV ¯ , (5.82)
            where dE is the change in the internal energy of A. Because dS = dQ¯ /T, the increase in entropy
            of system A is written
            dS = dE + p dV ¯
            T . (5.83)
            Likewise, the increase in entropy of system A is given by
            dS  = dE + p¯ dV
            T . (5.84)
            According to Equation (5.83),

            where the subscripts are to remind us what is held constant in the partial derivatives. We can write
            an analogous pair of equations for the system A
            .
            The overall system is assumed to be isolated, so conservation of energy gives dE + dE = 0.
            Furthermore, Equation (5.81) implies that dV +dV = 0. It follows that the total change in entropy
            is given by
            dS (0) = dS + dS  =

            dV. (5.87)
            The equilibrium state is the most probable state. (See Section 5.2.) According to statistical mechanics, this is equivalent to the state with the largest number of accessible microstates. Finally,
            Equation (5.78) implies that this is the maximum entropy state. The system can never spontaneously leave a maximum entropy state, because this would imply a spontaneous reduction in entropy, which is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics. A maximum or minimum entropy
            state must satisfy dS (0) = 0 for arbitrary small variations of the energy and external parameters. It
            follows from Equation (5.87) that
            T = T
            , (5.88)
            p¯ = p¯

            that
            
            ∂2S
            ∂E 2
            
            V

            ∂2S
            ∂V 2
            
            E
            < 0, (5.91)
            with a similar pair of inequalities for system A
            . The usual estimate Ω ∝ E f
            V f (see Section 3.8),
            giving S = k f ln E + k f ln V + ··· , ensures that the previous inequalities are satisfied in conventional macroscopic systems. In the maximum entropy state, the systems A and A have equal
            temperatures (i.e., they are in thermal equilibrium), and equal pressures (i.e., they are in mechanical equilibrium). The second law of thermodynamics implies that the two interacting systems will
            evolve towards this state, and will then remain in it indefinitely (if left undisturbed).
            5.9 Entropy and Quantum Mechanics
            The entropy, S , of a system is defined in terms of the number, Ω, of accessible microstates consistent with an overall energy in the range E to E + δE via
            S = k ln Ω. (5.92)
            We have already demonstrated that this definition is utterly insensitive to the resolution, δE, to
            which the macroscopic energy is measured (See Section 5.7.) In classical mechanics, if a system
            Statistical Thermodynamics 71
            possesses f degrees of freedom then phase-space is conventionally subdivided into cells of arbitrarily chosen volume h f
            0 . (See Section 3.2.) The number of accessible microstates is equivalent
            to the number of these cells in the volume of phase-space consistent with an overall energy of the
            system lying in the range E to E + δE. Thus,
            Ω = 1
            h f
            0
            
            ··· 
            dq1 ··· dqf d p1 ··· d pf , (5.93)
            giving
            S = k ln 
            ···
            dq1 ··· dqf d p1 ··· d pf
            
            − k f ln h0. (5.94)
            Thus, in classical mechanics, the entropy is undetermined to an arbitrary additive constant that
            depends on the size of the cells in phase-space. In fact, S increases as the cell size decreases.
            The second law of thermodynamics is only concerned with changes in entropy, and is, therefore,
            unaffected by an additive constant. Likewise, macroscopic thermodynamical quantities, such as
            the temperature and pressure, that can be expressed as partial derivatives of the entropy with respect to various macroscopic parameters [see Equations (5.85) and (5.86)] are unaffected by such
            a constant. So, in classical mechanics, the entropy is rather like a gravitational potential—it is
            undetermined to an additive constant, but this does not affect any physical laws.
            The non-unique value of the entropy comes about because there is no limit to the precision
            to which the state of a classical system can be specified. In other words, the cell size, h0, can be
            made arbitrarily small, which corresponds to specifying the particle coordinates and momenta to
            arbitrary accuracy. However, in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle sets a definite limit
            to how accurately the particle coordinates and momenta can be specified. (See Section C.8.) In
            general,
            δqi δpi ≥ /2, (5.95)
            where  is Planck’s constant over 2π, pi is the momentum conjugate to the generalized coordinate
            qi, and δqi, δpi are the uncertainties in these quantities, respectively. In fact, in quantum mechanics,
            the number of accessible quantum states with the overall energy in the range E to E + δE is
            completely determined. This implies that, in reality, the entropy of a system has a unique and
            unambiguous value. Quantum mechanics can often be “mocked up” in classical mechanics by
            setting the cell size in phase-space equal to Planck’s constant, so that h0 = h. This automatically
            enforces the most restrictive form of the uncertainty principle, δqi δpi  /2. In many systems, the
            substitution h0 → h in Equation (5.94) gives the same, unique value for S as that obtained from a
            full quantum-mechanical calculation. (See Section 8.10.)
            Consider a simple quantum-mechanical system consisting of N non-interacting spinless particles of mass m confined in a cubic box of dimension L. (See Section C.10.) The energy levels of
            the ith particle are given by
            ei = 2π2
            2 m L2
            
            n2
            1 i + n2
            2 i + n2
            3 i
            
            , (5.96)
            where n1 i, n2 i, and n3 i are three (positive) quantum numbers. The overall energy of the system is
            72 5.9. Entropy and Quantum Mechanics
            the sum of the energies of the individual particles, so that for a general state r,
            Er =
            
            i=1,N
            ei. (5.97)
            The overall state of the system is completely specified by 3N quantum numbers, so the number
            of degrees of freedom is f = 3N. The classical limit corresponds to the situation where all of the
            quantum numbers are much greater than unity. In this limit, the number of accessible states varies
            with energy according to our usual estimate Ω ∝ E f
            . (See Section 3.8.) The lowest possible energy
            state of the system, the so-called ground-state, corresponds to the situation where all quantum
            numbers take their lowest possible value, unity. Thus, the ground-state energy, E0, is given by
            E0 = f 2 π2
            2 m L2 . (5.98)
            There is only one accessible microstate at the ground-state energy (i.e., that where all quantum
            numbers are unity), so by our usual definition of entropy,
            S (E0) = k ln 1 = 0. (5.99)
            In other words, there is no disorder in the system when all the particles are in their ground-states.
            Clearly, as the energy approaches the ground-state energy, the number of accessible states
            becomes far less than the usual classical estimate E f
            . This is true for all quantum mechanical
            systems. In general, the number of microstates varies roughly like
            Ω(E) ∼ 1 + C (E − E0) f
            , (5.100)
            where C is a positive constant. According to Equation (5.31), the temperature varies approximately
            like
            T ∼ E − E0
            k f , (5.101)
            provided Ω 
             1. Thus, as the absolute temperature of a system approaches zero, the internal
            energy approaches a limiting value E0 (the quantum-mechanical ground-state energy), and the
            entropy approaches the limiting value zero. This proposition is known as the third law of thermodynamics.
            At low temperatures, great care must be taken to ensure that equilibrium thermodynamical
            arguments are applicable, because the rate of attaining equilibrium may be very slow. Another
            difficulty arises when dealing with a system in which the atoms possess nuclear spins. Typically,
            when such a system is brought to a very low temperature, the entropy associated with the degrees of
            freedom not involving nuclear spins becomes negligible. Nevertheless, the number of microstates,
            Ωs, corresponding to the possible nuclear spin orientations may be very large. Indeed, it may
            be just as large as the number of states at room temperature. The reason for this is that nuclear
            magnetic moments are extremely small, and, therefore, have extremely weak mutual interactions.
            Thus, it only takes a tiny amount of heat energy in the system to completely randomize the spin
            orientations. Typically, a temperature as small as 10 −3 degrees kelvin is sufficient to randomize the
            spins.
            Statistical Thermodynamics 73
            Suppose that the system consists of N atoms with nuclei of spin 1/2. Each spin can have two
            possible orientations. If there is enough residual heat energy in the system to randomize the spins
            then each orientation is equally likely. It follows that there are Ωs = 2 N accessible spin states. The
            entropy associated with these states is S 0 = k ln Ωs = ν R ln 2. Below some critical temperature,
            T0, the interaction between the nuclear spins becomes significant, and the system settles down
            in some unique quantum-mechanical ground-state (e.g., with all spins aligned). In this situation,
            S → 0, in accordance with the third law of thermodynamics. However, for temperatures which
            are small, but not small enough to “freeze out” the nuclear spin degrees of freedom, the entropy
            approaches a limiting value, S 0, that depends only on the kinds of atomic nuclei in the system. This
            limiting value is independent of the spatial arrangement of the atoms, or the interactions between
            them. Thus, for most practical purposes, the third law of thermodynamics can be written
            as T → 0+, S → S 0, (5.102)
            where 0+ denotes a temperature that is very close to absolute zero, but still much larger than T0.
            This modification of the third law is useful because it can be applied at temperatures that are not
            prohibitively low.
            5.10 Laws of Thermodynamics
            We have now come to the end of our investigation of the fundamental postulates of classical and
            statistical thermodynamics. The remainder of this course is devoted to the application of the ideas
            that we have just discussed to various situations of interest in physics. Before we proceed, however,
            it is useful to summarize the results of our investigations. Our summary takes the form of a number
            of general statements regarding macroscopic variables that are usually referred to as the laws of
            thermodynamics:
            Zeroth Law: If two systems are separately in thermal equilibrium with a third system
            then they must be in thermal equilibrium with one another. (See Section. 5.3.)
            First Law: The change in internal energy of a system in going from one macrostate
            to another is the difference between the net heat absorbed by the system from its surroundings, and the net work done by the system on its surroundings. (See Section 4.1.)
            Second Law: The entropy of an isolated system can never spontaneously decrease.
            (See Section 5.6.)
            Third Law: In the limit as the absolute temperature tends to zero, the entropy also
            tends to zero. (See Section 5.9.)

            either parallel or antiparallel to an applied magnetic field, B. The energy, E, of the system
            is then E = −(n1 − n2) µ B, where n1 is the number of spins aligned parallel to B, and n2 the

            few months later, the experimenter happens to read in a journal that the particular glass of
            which the bulb is made is quite permeable to helium, but not to any other gas. Assuming
            that equilibrium has been reached by this time, what gas pressure will the experimenter

            5.5 A solid contains N magnetic atoms having spin 1/2. At sufficiently high temperatures,
            each spin is completely randomly oriented. In other words, it is equally likely to be in
            either one of two possible states. But at sufficiently low temperature, the interactions between the magnetic atoms causes them to exhibit ferromagnetism, with the result that their
            spins become oriented in the same direction. A very crude approximation suggests that
            the spin-dependent contribution, C(T), to the heat capacity of the solid has an approximate
            temperature dependence given by

            otherwise. The abrupt increase in specific heat as T is reduced below T1 is due to the
            onset of ferromagnetic behavior. Find two expressions for the increase in entropy as the
            temperature of the system is raised from a value below T1/2 to one above T1. By equating
            these two expressions, show that
            C1 = 2.26 N k.

            6.1 Introduction
            We have already learned that macroscopic quantities, such as energy, temperature, and pressure,
            are, in fact, statistical in nature. In other words, in an equilibrium state, they exhibit random
            fluctuations about some mean value. If we were to plot the probability distribution for the energy
            (say) of a system in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings then we would obtain a Gaussian
            distribution with a very small fractional width. In fact, we expect
            ∆∗E
            E ∼ 1
            f
            , (6.1)
            where the number of degrees of freedom, f , is about 1024 for laboratory-scale systems. This implies that the statistical fluctuations of macroscopic quantities about their mean values are typically
            only about 1 part in 1012.
            Because the statistical fluctuations of equilibrium quantities are so small, it is an excellent
            approximation to neglect them altogether, and, thereby, to replace macroscopic quantities, such
            as energy, temperature, and pressure, by their mean values. In other words, E → E, T → T,
            p → p¯, et cetera. In the following discussion, we shall drop the overbars, so that E should be
            understood to represent the mean energy, E, et cetera. This prescription, which is the essence
            of classical thermodynamics, is equivalent to replacing all statistically-varying quantities by their
            most probable values.
            Although, formally, there are four laws of thermodynamics (i.e., the zeroth to the third), the
            zeroth law is really a consequence of the second law, and the third law is only important at temperatures close to absolute zero. So, for most practical purposes, the two laws that actually matter
            are the first law and the second law.
            For an infinitesimal process, the first law of thermodynamics is written
            dQ¯ = dE +dW¯ , (6.2)
            where dE is the change in internal energy of the system, ¯dQ the heat absorbed by the system from
            its surroundings, and ¯dW the work done by the system on its surroundings. Note that this particular
            formulation of the first law is merely a convention. We could equally well write the first law in
            terms of the heat emitted by the system, or the work done on the system. It does not really matter,
            as long as we are consistent in our definitions. The second law of thermodynamics implies that
            dQ¯ = T dS, (6.3)
            for an infinitesimal quasi-static process, where T is the thermodynamic temperature, and dS the
            change in entropy of the system. Furthermore, for systems in which the only external parameter is
            the volume (e.g., gases), the work done on the environment is
            dW¯ = p dV, (6.4)
            78 6.2. Ideal Gas Equation of State
            where p is the pressure, and dV the change in volume. Thus, the first and second laws of thermodynamics can be combined to give the fundamental thermodynamic relation
            T dS = dE + p dV. (6.5)
            6.2 Ideal Gas Equation of State
            Let us commence our discussion of classical thermodynamics by considering the simplest possible
            macroscopic system, which is an ideal gas. All of the thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas are
            summed up in its equation of state, which specifies the relationship between its pressure, volume,
            and temperature. Unfortunately, classical thermodynamics is unable determine this equation of
            state from first principles. In fact, classical thermodynamics cannot determine anything from first
            principles. We always need to provide some initial information before classical thermodynamics
            can generate new results. This initial information may come from statistical physics (i.e., from our
            knowledge of the microscopic structure of the system under consideration), but, more usually, it
            is empirical in nature (i.e., it is obtained from experiments). In fact, the ideal gas law was first
            discovered empirically by Robert Boyle. Nowadays, however, it can be justified via statistical
            arguments, as is described in the following.
            Recall (from Section 3.8) that the number of accessible states of a monotonic ideal gas varies
            like
            Ω ∝ V N χ(E), (6.6)
            where N is the number of atoms, and χ(E) depends only on the energy of the gas (and is, therefore,
            independent of the volume). We obtained this result by integrating over the volume of accessible
            phase-space. Because the energy of an ideal gas is independent of the atomic coordinates (given
            that there are no interatomic forces in an ideal gas), the integrals over these coordinates just reduced to N simultaneous volume integrals, giving the V N factor in the previous expression. The
            integrals over the particle momenta were more complicated, but were clearly independent of V,
            giving the χ(E) factor in the previous expression. Consider the following statistical result [see
            Equation (5.41)]:
            Xα = 1
            β
            ∂ ln Ω
            ∂xα
            (6.7)
            where Xα is the mean force conjugate to the external parameter xα (i.e., ¯dW = 
            α Xα dxα), and
            β = 1/(k T). For an ideal gas, the only external parameter is the volume, and its conjugate force is
            the pressure (because ¯dW = p dV). So, we can write
            p = 1
            β
            ∂ ln Ω
            ∂V . (6.8)
            It immediately follows from Equation (6.6) that
            p = NkT
            V . (6.9)
            Classical Thermodynamics 79
            However, N = ν NA, where ν is the number of moles, and NA is Avagadro’s number. Also, k NA = R,
            where R is the molar ideal gas constant. This allows us to write the equation of state in its standard
            form
            p V = ν R T. (6.10)
            Incidentally, the fact that Ω = Ω(V, E) in Equation (6.6) suggests that the macroscopic state of an
            ideal gas can be uniquely specified by giving the values of two independent parameters (e.g., the
            energy and the volume, the pressure and the volume, the temperature and the volume, et cetera).
            The previous derivation of the ideal gas equation of state is rather elegant. It is certainly
            far easier to obtain the equation of state in this manner than to treat the atoms that make up the
            gas as tiny billiard balls continually bouncing off the walls of a container. The latter derivation
            is difficult to perform correctly, because it is necessary to average over all possible directions
            of atomic motion. (See Section 7.16.) It is clear, from the previous derivation, that the crucial
            element needed to obtain the ideal gas equation of state is the absence of interatomic forces. This
            automatically gives rise to a variation of the number of accessible states with E and V of the
            form (6.6), which, in turn, implies the ideal gas law. So, the ideal gas law should also apply to
            polyatomic gases with no inter-molecular forces. Polyatomic gases are more complicated that
            monatomic gases because the molecules can rotate and vibrate, giving rise to extra degrees of
            freedom, in addition to the translational degrees of freedom of a monatomic gas. In other words,
            χ(E), in Equation (6.6), becomes much more complicated in polyatomic gases. However, as long
            as there are no inter-molecular forces, the volume dependence of Ω is still V N, and the ideal gas
            law should still hold true. In fact, we shall discover that the extra degrees of freedom of polyatomic
            gases manifest themselves by increasing the specific heat capacity. (See Section 7.13.)
            There is one other conclusion that we can draw from Equation (6.6). The statistical definition
            of temperature is
            1
            k T = ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E . (6.11)
            [See Equation (5.31).] It follows that
            1
            k T = ∂ ln χ
            ∂E . (6.12)
            We can see that, because χ is a function of the energy, but not of the volume, the temperature must
            also be a function of the energy, but not the volume. This implies that
            E = E(T). (6.13)
            In other words, the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on the temperature of the gas,
            and is independent of the volume. This is a fairly obvious result, because if there are no intermolecular forces then increasing the volume, which effectively increases the mean separation between molecules, is not going to affect the molecular energies. Hence, the energy of the whole gas
            is unaffected.
            The volume independence of the internal energy can also be derived directly from the ideal gas
            equation of state. The internal energy of a gas can be considered to be a general function of the
            temperature and volume, so that
            E = E(T, V). (6.14)
            80 6.2. Ideal Gas Equation of State
            It follows from mathematics that
            dE =
            
            ∂E
            ∂T

            ∂V
            
            T
            dV, (6.15)
            where the subscript V reminds us that the first partial derivative is taken at constant volume, and
            the subscript T reminds us that the second partial derivative is taken at constant temperature. The
            first and second laws of thermodynamics imply that for a quasi-static change of parameters,
            T dS = dE + p dV. (6.16)
            [See Equation (6.5).] The ideal gas equation of state, (6.10), can be used to express the pressure in
            term of the volume and the temperature in the previous expression:
            dS = 1
            T
            dE +
            ν R
            V
            dV. (6.17)
            Using Equation (6.15), this becomes
            dS = 1
            T

            
            dV. (6.18)
            However, dS is the exact differential of a well-defined state function, S . This means that we can
            consider the entropy to be a function of the temperature and volume. Thus, S = S (T, V), and
            mathematics immediately yields
            dS =
            
            ∂S
            ∂T

            dV. (6.19)
            The previous expression is valid for all small values of dT and dV, so a comparison with Equation (6.18) gives
            
            ∂S

            A well-known property of partial differentials is the equality of second derivatives, irrespective of
            the order of differentiation, so
            ∂2S
            ∂V ∂T = ∂2S
            ∂T ∂V . (6.22)

            Because second derivatives are equivalent, irrespective of the order of differentiation, the previous

            T

            which implies that the internal energy is independent of the volume for any gas obeying the ideal
            equation of state. This result was confirmed experimentally by James Joule in the middle of the
            nineteenth century.
            6.3 Specific Heat
            Suppose that a body absorbs an amount of heat ∆Q, and its temperature consequently rises by ∆T.
            The usual definition of the heat capacity, or specific heat, of the body is
            C = ∆Q
            ∆T . (6.26)
            If the body consists of ν moles of some substance then the molar specific heat (i.e., the specific
            heat of one mole of this substance) is defined
            c = 1
            ν
            ∆Q
            ∆T . (6.27)
            In writing the previous expressions, we have tacitly assumed that the specific heat of a body is
            independent of its temperature. In general, this is not true. We can overcome this problem by only
            allowing the body in question to absorb a very small amount of heat, so that its temperature only
            rises slightly, and its specific heat remains approximately constant. In the limit that the amount of
            absorbed heat becomes infinitesimal, we obtain
            c = 1
            ν
            dQ¯
            dT . (6.28)
            In classical thermodynamics, it is usual to define two molar specific heats. Firstly, the molar
            specific heat at constant volume, denoted
            cV = 1
            ν
            
            dQ¯
            dT 
            V
            , (6.29)
            and, secondly, the molar specific heat at constant pressure, denoted
            cp = 1
            ν
            
            dQ¯
            dT 
            p
            . (6.30)
            Consider the molar specific heat at constant volume of an ideal gas. Because dV = 0, no work
            is done by the gas on its surroundings, and the first law of thermodynamics reduces to
            dQ¯ = dE. (6.31)
            82 6.3. Specific Heat
            It follows from Equation (6.29) that
            cV = 1
            ν
            
            ∂E
            ∂T
            
            V
            . (6.32)
            Now, for an ideal gas, the internal energy is volume independent. [See Equation (6.25).] Thus, the
            previous expression implies that the specific heat at constant volume is also volume independent.
            Because E is a function of T only, we can write
            dE =
            
            ∂E
            ∂T
            
            V
            dT. (6.33)
            The previous two expressions can be combined to give
            dE = ν cV dT (6.34)
            for an ideal gas.
            Let us now consider the molar specific heat at constant pressure of an ideal gas. In general, if
            the pressure is kept constant then the volume changes, and so the gas does work on its environment.
            According to the first law of thermodynamics,
            dQ¯ = dE + p dV = ν cV dT + p dV, (6.35)
            where use has been made of Equation (6.34). The equation of state of an ideal gas, (6.10), implies that if the volume changes by dV, the temperature changes by dT, and the pressure remains
            constant, then
            p dV = ν R dT. (6.36)
            The previous two equations can be combined to give
            dQ¯ = ν cV dT + ν R dT. (6.37)
            Now, by definition,
            cp = 1
            ν
            
            dQ¯
            dT 
            p
            , (6.38)
            so we obtain
            cp = cV + R (6.39)
            for an ideal gas. Note that, at constant volume, all of the heat absorbed by the gas goes into
            increasing its internal energy, and, hence, its temperature, whereas, at constant pressure, some of
            the absorbed heat is used to do work on the environment as the volume increases. This means that,
            in the latter case, less heat is available to increase the temperature of the gas. Thus, we expect the
            specific heat at constant pressure to exceed that at constant volume, as indicated by the previous
            formula.
            The ratio of the two specific heats, cp/cV, is conventionally denoted γ. We have
            γ ≡
            cp

            for an ideal gas. In fact, γ is easy to measure experimentally because the speed of sound in an ideal
            gas takes the form
            u =
            γ p
            ρ , (6.41)
            where ρ is the mass density. (See Exercise 6.8.) Table 6.1 lists some experimental measurements
            of cV and γ for common gases. The extent of the agreement between γ calculated from Equation (6.40) and the experimental γ is remarkable.
            6.4 Calculation of Specific Heats
            Now that we know the relationship between the molar specific heats at constant volume and constant pressure for an ideal gas, it would be interesting if we could calculate either one of these
            quantities from first principles. Classical thermodynamics cannot help us here. However, it is
            straightforward to calculate the specific heat at constant volume using our knowledge of statistical
            physics. Recall that the variation of the number of accessible states of an ideal gas with energy and
            volume is written
            Ω(E, V) ∝ V N χ(E). (6.42)
            In fact, for the specific case of a monatomic ideal gas, we worked out a more exact expression for
            Ω in Section 3.8: namely,
            Ω(E, V) = B V N E 3N/2
            , (6.43)
            where B is a constant independent of the energy and volume. It follows that
            ln Ω = ln B + N ln V +
            3N
            2
            ln E. (6.44)
            The absolute temperature is given by [see Equation (5.30)]
            β ≡
            1
            k T = ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E = 3N

            E, (6.45)
            so
            E = 3
            2 NkT. (6.46)
            84 6.5. Isothermal and Adiabatic Expansion
            Because N = ν NA, and NA k = R, we can rewrite the previous expression as
            E = 3
            2 ν R T, (6.47)
            where R = 8.3143 joules/mole/degree is the molar ideal gas constant. The previous formula tells
            us exactly how the internal energy of a monatomic ideal gas depends on its temperature.
            The molar specific heat at constant volume of a monatomic ideal gas is clearly
            cV = 1

            R. (6.48)
            This has the numerical value
            cV = 12.47 joules/mole/degree. (6.49)
            Furthermore, we have
            cp = cV + R = 5
            2
            R, (6.50)
            and
            γ ≡
            cp
            cV
            = 5
            3 = 1.667. (6.51)
            We can see from Table 6.1 that these predictions are borne out fairly well for the monatomic
            gases helium and argon. Note that the specific heats of polyatomic gases are larger than those of
            monatomic gases, because polyatomic molecules can rotate around their centers of mass, as well
            as translate, so polyatomic gases can store energy in the rotational, as well as the translational,
            energy states of their constituent particles. We shall analyze this effect in greater detail later on in
            this course. (See Section 7.13.)
            6.5 Isothermal and Adiabatic Expansion
            Suppose that the temperature of an ideal gas is held constant by keeping the gas in thermal contact with a heat reservoir. If the gas is allowed to expand quasi-statically under these so-called
            isothermal conditions then the ideal gas equation of state tells us that
            p V = constant. (6.52)
            This result is known as the isothermal gas law.
            Suppose, now, that the gas is thermally isolated from its surroundings. If the gas is allowed to
            expand quasi-statically under these so-called adiabatic conditions then it does work on its environment, and, hence, its internal energy is reduced, and its temperature changes. Let us calculate the
            relationship between the pressure and volume of the gas during adiabatic expansion. According to
            the first law of thermodynamics,
            dQ¯ = ν cV dT + p dV = 0, (6.53)
            Classical Thermodynamics 85
            in an adiabatic process (in which no heat is absorbed). [See Equation (6.35).] The ideal gas
            equation of state, (6.10), can be differentiated, yielding
            p dV + V dp = ν R dT. (6.54)
            The temperature increment, dT, can be eliminated between the previous two expressions to give
            0 = cV
            R (p dV + V dp) + p dV =
            
            
            cV
            R
            + 1
            
            p dV +
            cV
            R V dp, (6.55)
            which reduces to
            (cV + R) p dV + cV V dp = 0. (6.56)
            Dividing through by cV p V yields
            γ
            dV
            V
            + d p
            p = 0, (6.57)
            where
            γ ≡
            cp
            cV
            = cV + R
            cV
            . (6.58)
            It turns out that cV is a slowly-varying function of temperature in most gases. Consequently, it is
            usually a good approximation to treat the ratio of specific heats, γ, as a constant, at least over a
            limited temperature range. If γ is constant then we can integrate Equation (6.57) to give
            γ ln V + ln p = constant, (6.59)
            or
            p V γ = constant. (6.60)
            This result is known as the adiabatic gas law. It is straightforward to obtain analogous relationships
            between V and T, and between p and T, during adiabatic expansion or contraction. In fact, because
            p = ν R T/V, the previous formula also implies that
            T V γ−1 = constant, (6.61)
            and
            p1−γ T γ = constant. (6.62)
            Equations (6.60)–(6.62) are all completely equivalent.
            6.6 Hydrostatic Equilibrium of Atmosphere
            The gas that we are most familiar with in everyday life is, of course, the Earth’s atmosphere. It
            turns out that we can use the isothermal and adiabatic gas laws to explain most of the observed
            features of the atmosphere.
            Let us, first of all, consider the hydrostatic equilibrium of the atmosphere. Consider a thin
            vertical slice of the atmosphere, of cross-sectional area A, that starts at height z above ground
            86 6.7. Isothermal Atmosphere
            level, and extends to height z + dz. The upward force exerted on this slice by the gas below it is
            p(z) A, where p(z) is the pressure at height z. Likewise, the downward force exerted by the gas
            above the slice is p(z + dz) A. The net upward force is [p(z) − p(z + dz)] A. In equilibrium, this
            upward force must be balanced by the downward force due to the weight of the slice, which is
            ρ A dz g, where ρ is the mass density of the gas, and g the acceleration due to gravity. It follows
            that the force balance condition can be written
            [p(z) − p(z + dz)] A = ρ A dz g, (6.63)
            which reduces to
            d p
            dz = −ρ g. (6.64)
            This result is known as the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for the atmosphere.
            We can express the mass density of a gas in the following form,
            ρ = ν µ
            V , (6.65)
            where µ is the molecular weight of the gas, and is equal to the mass of one mole of gas particles.
            For instance, the molecular weight of nitrogen gas is 28 × 10−3 kg. The previous formula for the
            mass density of a gas, combined with the ideal gas law, p V = ν R T, yields
            ρ = p µ
            R T . (6.66)
            It follows that the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium can be rewritten
            d p
            p = − µ g
            R T dz. (6.67)
            6.7 Isothermal Atmosphere
            As a first approximation, let us assume that the temperature of the atmosphere is uniform. In such
            an isothermal atmosphere, we can directly integrate the previous equation to give
            p = p0 exp 
            − z
            z0
            
            . (6.68)
            Here, p0 is the pressure at ground level (z = 0), which is generally about 1 bar (105 N m−2 in SI
            units). The quantity
            z0 = R T
            µ g
            (6.69)
            is known as the isothermal scale-height of the atmosphere. At ground level, the atmospheric
            temperature is, on average, about 15◦ C, which is 288 K on the absolute scale. The mean molecular
            weight of air at sea level is 29 × 10−3 kg (i.e., the molecular weight of a gas made up of 78%
            nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% argon). The mean acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m s−2 at
            Classical Thermodynamics 87
            ground level. Also, the molar ideal gas constant is 8.314 joules/mole/degree. Combining all of this
            information, the isothermal scale-height of the atmosphere comes out to be about 8.4 kilometers.
            We have discovered that, in an isothermal atmosphere, the pressure decreases exponentially
            with increasing height. Because the temperature is assumed to be constant, and ρ ∝ p/T [see
            Equation (6.66)], it follows that the density also decreases exponentially with the same scaleheight as the pressure. According to Equation (6.68), the pressure, or the density, of the atmosphere decreases by a factor 10 every ln10 z0, or 19.3 kilometers, increase in altitude above sea
            level. Clearly, the effective height of the atmosphere is very small compared to the Earth’s radius,
            which is about 6, 400 kilometers. In other words, the atmosphere constitutes a relatively thin layer
            covering the surface of the Earth. Incidentally, this justifies our neglect of the decrease of g with
            increasing altitude.
            One of the highest points in the United States of America is the peak of Mount Elbert in Colorado. This peak lies 14, 432 feet, or about 4.4 kilometers, above sea level. At this altitude, Equation (6.68) predicts that the air pressure should be about 0.6 atmospheres. Surprisingly enough,
            after a few days acclimatization, people can survive quite comfortably at this sort of pressure.
            In the highest inhabited regions of the Andes and Tibet, the air pressure falls to about 0.5 atmospheres. Humans can just about survive at such pressures. However, people cannot survive for any
            extended period in air pressures below half an atmosphere. This sets an upper limit on the altitude
            of permanent human habitation, which is about 19, 000 feet, or 5.8 kilometers, above sea level.
            Incidentally, this is also the maximum altitude at which a pilot can fly an unpressurized aircraft
            without requiring additional oxygen.
            The highest point in the world is, of course, the peak of Mount Everest in Nepal. This peak
            lies at an altitude of 29, 028 feet, or 8.85 kilometers, above sea level, where we expect the air
            pressure to be a mere 0.35 atmospheres. This explains why Mount Everest was only conquered
            after lightweight portable oxygen cylinders were invented. Admittedly, some climbers have subsequently ascended Mount Everest without the aid of additional oxygen, but this is a very foolhardy
            venture, because, above 19, 000 feet, the climbers are slowly dying.
            Commercial airliners fly at a cruising altitude of 32, 000 feet. At this altitude, we expect the
            air pressure to be only 0.3 atmospheres, which explains why airline cabins are pressurized. In
            fact, the cabins are only pressurized to 0.85 atmospheres (which accounts for the “popping” of
            passangers ears during air travel). The reason for this partial pressurization is quite simple. At
            32, 000 feet, the pressure difference between the air in the cabin, and hence that outside, is about
            half an atmosphere. Clearly, the walls of the cabin must be strong enough to support this pressure
            difference, which means that they must be of a certain thickness, and, hence, that the aircraft must
            be of a certain weight. If the cabin were fully pressurized then the pressure difference at cruising
            altitude would increase by about 30%, which means that the cabin walls would have to be much
            thicker, and, hence, the aircraft would have to be substantially heavier. So, a fully pressurized
            aircraft would be more comfortable to fly in (because your ears would not “pop”), but it would
            also be far less economical to operate.
            88 6.8. Adiabatic Atmosphere
            6.8 Adiabatic Atmosphere
            Of course, we know that the atmosphere is not isothermal. In fact, air temperature falls quite
            noticeably with increasing altitude. In ski resorts, the general rule of thumb is that the temperature
            drops by about 1 degree per 100 meters increase in altitude. Many people cannot understand why
            the atmosphere gets colder with increasing height. They reason that because higher altitudes are
            closer to the Sun they ought to be hotter. In fact, the explanation is quite simple. It depends on
            three important properties of air. The first property is that air is transparent to most, but by no
            means all, of the electromagnetic spectrum. In particular, most infrared radiation, which carries
            heat energy, passes straight through the lower atmosphere, and heats the ground. In other words,
            the lower atmosphere is heated from below, not from above. The second important property of
            air is that it is constantly in motion. In fact, the lower 20 kilometers of the atmosphere (the socalled troposphere) are fairly thoroughly mixed. You might think that this would imply that the
            atmosphere is isothermal. However, this is not the case because of the final important property of
            air: namely, it is a very poor conductor of heat. This, of course, is why woolly sweaters work—
            they trap a layer of air close to the body, and, because air is such a poor conductor of heat, you stay
            warm.
            Imagine a packet of air that is swirling around in the atmosphere. We would expect it to always
            remain at the same pressure as its surroundings, otherwise it would be mechanically unstable. It
            is also plausible that the packet moves around too quickly to effectively exchange heat with its
            surroundings, because air is very a poor heat conductor, and heat flow is consequently quite a slow
            process. So, to a first approximation, the air in the packet is adiabatic. In a steady-state atmosphere,
            we expect that, as the packet moves upwards, expands due to the reduced pressure, and cools
            adiabatically, its temperature always remains the same as that of its immediate surroundings. This
            means that we can use the adiabatic gas law to characterize the cooling of the atmosphere with
            increasing altitude. In this particular case, the most useful manifestation of the adiabatic law is
            p1−γ T γ = constant, (6.70)
            giving
            d p
            p = γ
            γ − 1
            dT
            T . (6.71)
            Combining the previous expression with the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, (6.67), we obtain
            γ
            γ − 1
            dT
            T = − µ g
            R T dz, (6.72)
            or
            dT
            dz = −γ − 1
            γ
            µ g
            R . (6.73)
            Now, the ratio of specific heats for air (which is effectively a diatomic gas) is about 1.4. (See
            Table 6.1.) Hence, we can deduce, from the previous expression, that the temperature of the
            atmosphere decreases with increasing height at a constant rate of 9.8◦ C per kilometer. This value
            is called the (dry) adiabatic lapse rate of the atmosphere. Our calculation accords well with the “1
            Classical Thermodynamics 89
            degree colder per 100 meters higher” rule of thumb used in ski resorts. The basic reason that air is
            colder at higher altitudes is that it expands as its pressure decreases with height. It, therefore, does
            work on its environment, without absorbing any heat (because of its low thermal conductivity), so
            its internal energy, and, hence, its temperature decreases.
            According to the adiabatic lapse rate calculated previously, the air temperature at the cruising
            altitude of airliners (32, 000 feet) should be about −80◦ C (assuming a sea level temperature of
            15◦ C). In fact, this is somewhat of an underestimate. A more realistic value is about −60◦ C.
            The explanation for this discrepancy is the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere. As air
            rises, expands, and cools, water vapor condenses out, releasing latent heat, which prevents the
            temperature from falling as rapidly with height as the adiabatic lapse rate would predict. (See
            Exercise 9.6.) In fact, in the tropics, where the air humidity is very high, the lapse rate of the
            atmosphere (i.e., the rate of decrease of temperature with altitude) is significantly less than the
            adiabatic value. The adiabatic lapse rate is only observed when the humidity is low. This is the
            case in deserts, in the arctic (where water vapor is frozen out of the atmosphere), and, of course, in
            ski resorts.
            Suppose that the lapse rate of the atmosphere differs from the adiabatic value. Let us ignore the
            complication of water vapor, and assume that the atmosphere is dry. Consider a packet of air that
            moves slightly upwards from its equilibrium height. The temperature of the packet will decrease
            with altitude according to the adiabatic lapse rate, because its expansion is adiabatic. We shall
            assume that the packet always maintains pressure balance with its surroundings. It follows that
            because ρ T ∝ p, according to the ideal gas law,
            (ρ T)packet = (ρ T)atmosphere. (6.74)
            If the atmospheric lapse rate is less than the adiabatic value then Tatmosphere > Tpacket implying
            that ρpacket > ρatmosphere. So, the packet will be denser than its immediate surroundings, and will,
            therefore, tend to fall back to its original height. Clearly, an atmosphere whose lapse rate is less
            than the adiabatic value is vertically stable. On the other hand, if the atmospheric lapse rate exceeds
            the adiabatic value then, after rising a little way, the packet will be less dense than its immediate
            surroundings, and will, therefore, continue to rise due to buoyancy effects. Clearly, an atmosphere
            whose lapse rate is greater than the adiabatic value is vertically unstable. This effect is of great
            importance in meteorology. The normal stable state of the atmosphere is for the lapse rate to be
            slightly less than the adiabatic value. Occasionally, however, the lapse rate exceeds the adiabatic
            value, and this is always associated with extremely disturbed weather patterns.
            Let us consider the temperature, pressure, and density profiles in an adiabatic atmosphere. We
            can directly integrate Equation (6.73) to give

            the isothermal scale-height calculated using this temperature. The pressure profile is easily calculated from the adiabatic gas law p1−γ T γ = constant, or p ∝ T γ/(γ−1). It follows that

            . (6.77)
            Consider the limit γ → 1. In this limit, Equation (6.75) yields T independent of height (i.e., the
            atmosphere becomes isothermal). We can evaluate Equation (6.77) in the limit as γ → 1 using the
            mathematical identity
            lt m→0 (1 + m x)
            1/m ≡ exp(x). (6.78)
            We obtain
            p = p0 exp 
            − z
            z0
            
            , (6.79)
            which, not surprisingly, is the predicted pressure variation in an isothermal atmosphere. In reality,
            the ratio of specific heats of the atmosphere is not unity, but is about 1.4 (i.e., the ratio for diatomic
            gases), which implies that in the real atmosphere
            p = p0
            
            1 − z
            3.5 z0
            3.5
            . (6.80)
            In fact, this formula gives very similar results to the isothermal formula, Equation (6.79), for
            heights below one scale-height (i.e., z < z0). For heights above one scale-height, the isothermal
            formula tends to predict too high a pressure. (See Figure 6.1.) So, in an adiabatic atmosphere,
            the pressure falls off more quickly with altitude than in an isothermal atmosphere, but this effect
            is only noticeable at pressures significantly below one atmosphere. In fact, the isothermal formula
            is a fairly good approximation below altitudes of about 10 kilometers. Because ρ ∝ p/T, the
            variation of density with height is
            ρ = ρ0

            2.5
            , (6.81)
            where ρ0 is the density at ground level. Thus, the density falls off more rapidly with altitude than
            the temperature, but less rapidly than the pressure.
            Note that an adiabatic atmosphere has a sharp upper boundary. Above height z1 = [γ/(γ−1)]z0,
            the temperature, pressure, and density are all zero. In other words, there is no atmosphere. For real
            air, with γ = 1.4, the upper boundary of an adiabatic atmosphere lies at height z1  3.5 z0  29.4
            kilometers above sea level. This behavior is quite different to that of an isothermal atmosphere,
            which has a diffuse upper boundary. In reality, there is no sharp upper boundary to the atmosphere.
            The adiabatic gas law does not apply above about 20 kilometers (i.e., in the stratosphere) because,
            at these altitudes, the air is no longer strongly mixed. Thus, in the stratosphere, the pressure falls
            off exponentially with increasing height.
            In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the temperature of the lower atmosphere should
            decrease approximately linearly with increasing height above ground level, while the pressure

            should decrease far more rapidly than the temperature, and the density should decrease at some
            intermediate rate. We have also shown that the lapse rate of the temperature should be about 10◦ C
            per kilometer in dry air, but somewhat less than this in wet air. In fact, all of these predictions are,
            more or less, correct. It is amazing that such accurate predictions can be obtained from the two
            simple laws—p V = constant for an isothermal gas, and p V γ = constant for an adiabatic gas.
            6.9 Internal Energy
            Equation (6.5) can be rearranged to give
            dE = T dS − p dV. (6.82)
            This equation shows how the internal energy, E, depends on independent variations of the entropy,
            S , and the volume, V. If S and V are considered to be the two independent parameters that specify
            the system then
            E = E(S, V). (6.83)
            It immediately follows that
            dE =

            we deduce that

            In fact, this is a necessary condition for dE in Equation (6.84) to be an exact differential. (See
            Section 4.5.) It follows from Equations (6.85) and (6.86) that

            6.10 Enthalpy
            The analysis in the previous section is based on the premise that S and V are the two independent
            parameters that specify the system. Suppose, however, that we choose S and p to be the two
            independent parameters. Because
            p dV = d(p V) − V dp, (6.90)
            we can rewrite Equation (6.82) in the form
            dH = T dS + V dp, (6.91)
            where
            H = E + p V (6.92)
            is termed the enthalpy. The name is derived from the Greek enthalpein, which means to “to warm
            in.”
            The analysis now proceeds in an analogous manner to that in the preceding section. First, we
            write
            H = H(S, p), (6.93)
            which implies that

            where
            F = E − T S (6.102)

            Proceeding as before, we write

            6.13 General Relation Between Specific Heats
            Consider a general homogeneous substance (not necessarily a gas) whose volume, V, is the only
            relevant external parameter. Let us find the general relationship between this substance’s molar
            specific heat at constant volume, cV, and its molar specific heat at constant pressure, cp.
            The heat capacity at constant volume is given by

            pressure, p. Let us consider these as the independent variables. Thus, S = S (T, p), which implies

            At constant p, we have

            At constant T, we have

            Finally, the molar volume of an ideal gas is
            v = V
            ν = R T
            p . (6.142)
            Hence, Equations (6.134), (6.138), (6.141), and (6.142) yield
            cp − cV = R, (6.143)
            which is identical to Equation (6.39).
            6.14 Free Expansion of Gas
            Consider a rigid container that is thermally insulated. The container is divided into two compartments separated by a valve that is initially closed. One compartment, of volume V1, contains the
            gas under investigation. The other compartment is empty. The initial temperature of the system is
            T1. The valve is now opened, and the gas is free to expand so as to fill the entire container, whose
            volume is V2. What is the temperature, T2, of the gas after the final equilibrium state has been
            reached?
            Because the system consisting of the gas and the container is adiabatically insulated, no heat
            flows into the system: that is,
            Q = 0. (6.144)
            98 6.14. Free Expansion of Gas
            Furthermore, the system does no work in the expansion process: that is,
            W = 0. (6.145)
            It follows from the first law of thermodynamics that the total energy of the system is conserved:
            that is,
            ∆E = Q − W = 0. (6.146)
            Let us assume that the container itself has negligible heat capacity (which, it turns out, is not a
            particularly realistic assumption—see later), so that the internal energy of the container does not
            change. Under these circumstances, the energy change of the system is equivalent to that of the
            gas. The conservation of energy, (6.146), thus reduces to
            E(T2, V2) = E(T1, V1), (6.147)
            where E(T, V) is the gas’s internal energy.
            To predict the outcome of the experiment, it is only necessary to know the internal energy of
            the gas, E(T, V), as a function of the temperature and the volume. If the initial parameters, T1
            and V1, are known, as well as the final volume, V2, then Equation (6.147) yields an equation that
            specifies the unknown final temperature, T2.
            For an ideal gas, the internal energy is independent of the volume: that is, E = E(T). (See
            Section 6.2.) In this case, Equation (6.147) yields
            E(T2) = E(T1), (6.148)
            which implies that T2 = T1. In other words, there is no temperature change in the free expansion
            of an ideal gas.
            The change in temperature of an non-ideal gas that undergoes free expansion can be written
            T2 = T1 +
             v2

            is termed the Joule coefficient. Here, v = V/ν is the molar volume, where ν is the number of moles
            of gas in the container. Furthermore, v1 = V1/ν and v2 = V2/ν.
            According to the first law of thermodynamics,
            dE = T dS − p dV. (6.151)

            6.15 Van der Waals Gas
            Consider a non-ideal gas whose equation of state takes the form
            
            
            p +
            a
            v 2
            
            (v − b) = R T, (6.156)
            where a and b are positive constants. (See Section 8.11.) Such a gas is known as a van der Waals
            gas. The previous approximate equation of state attempts to take into account the existence of longrange attractive forces between molecules in real gases, as well as the finite volume occupied by the
            molecules themselves. The attractive forces gives rise to a slight compression of the gas (relative
            to an ideal gas)—the term a/v 2 represents this additional positive pressure. The parameter b is the
            volume occupied by a mole of gas molecules. Thus, v → b as T → 0. Of course, in the limit a → 0
            and b → 0, the van der Waals equation of state reduces to the ideal gas equation of state.
            The van der Waals equation of state can be written
            p = R T
            v − b − a
            v 2 . (6.157)
            At fixed temperature, the previous equation yields p(v) curves that exhibit a maximum and a minimum at two points where (∂p/∂v)T = 0. At a particular temperature, the maximum and minimum
            100 6.15. Van der Waals Gas
            coalesce into a single inflection point where (∂2 p/∂v 2)T = 0, in addition to (∂p/∂v)T = 0. This
            point is called the critical point, and its temperature, pressure, and molar volume are denoted Tc,
            pc, and vc, respectively. It is readily demonstrated that
            Tc = 8 a
            27 R b, (6.158)
            pc = a
            27 b2 , (6.159)
            vc = 3 b. (6.160)
            (See Exercise 6.13.) The critical temperature, Tc, and the critical pressure, pc, of a substance
            are easily determined experimentally, because they turn out to be the maximum temperature and
            pressure, respectively, at which distinct liquid and gas phases exist. (See Section 9.10.) This allows
            a determination of the constants a and b in the van der Waals equation of state. In fact,
            a = 27
            64

            , (6.161)
            b = R Tc
            8 pc
            . (6.162)
            Table 6.2 shows the experimentally measured critical pressures and temperatures, as well as the
            derived van der Waal parameters, for some common gases.
            Let us calculate the Joule coefficient for a van der Waals gas. It follows from Equation (6.156)
            that
            
            ∂p
            ∂T
            
            V
            (v − b) = R, (6.163)
            which implies that
            T
            
            ∂p
            ∂T
            
            V
            = R T
            v − b = p +
            a
            v 2 . (6.164)
            Substitution into Equation (6.155) gives
            η = − a
            v 2 cV
            . (6.165)
            Thus, the Joule coefficient for a van der Waals gas is negative. This implies that the temperature
            of the gas always decreases as it undergoes free expansion. Of course, this temperature decrease
            is a consequence of the work done in overcoming the inter-molecular attractive forces. Over a
            relatively small temperature range, T2 < T < T1, any possible temperature dependence of cV is
            negligibly small. Thus, cV can be regarded as essentially constant, and Equations (6.149) and
            (6.165) yield
            T2 − T1 = − a

            v2
            
            . (6.166)
            For an expansion, where v2 > v1, this equation confirms that T2 < T1. In other words, the temperature of non-ideal gas that undergoes free expansion is reduced.
            Classical Thermodynamics 101
            In principle, it appears that the free expansion of a gas could provide a method of cooling
            the gas to low temperatures. In practice, a substantial difficulty arises because of the appreciable
            heat capacity, Cc, of the container. Because the container’s internal energy changes by an amount
            Cc (T2 − T1), the molar heat capacity, cV, in Equation (6.166), must be replaced by the total molar
            heat capacity, cV + Cc/ν. Given that the heat capacity of the container is generally much greater
            than that of the gas (i.e., Cc 
             ν cV), it follows that the actual temperature reduction is much
            smaller than that predicted by Equation (6.166).
            6.16 Joule-Thompson Throttling
            The difficulty associated with the presence of containing walls can be overcome by replacing the
            single-event free-expansion process just described (where this one event must supply the energy
            necessary to change the container temperature) with a continuous-flow process (where the temperature of the walls can adjust itself initially, and remains unchanged after a steady-state has been
            achieved). We shall now discuss a specific example of such a process that was first suggested by
            Joule and Thompson.
            Consider a pipe with thermally insulated walls. A porous plug in the pipe provides a constriction in the flow. A continuous stream of gas flows through the pipe. The constriction in the flow,
            due to the presence of the plug, results in a constant pressure difference being maintained across
            the plug. Let p1 and T1 be the pressure and temperature of the gas upstream of the plug, respectively, and let p2 and T2 be the downstream pressure and temperature, respectively. We expect the
            upstream pressure to exceed the downstream pressure (i.e., p1 > p2), otherwise gas would not be
            forced through the plug (in the upstream to downstream direction). But, how is the downstream
            temperature, T2, related to the upstream temperature, T1?
            Consider a mass of gas, M, that flows from the upstream to the downstream side of the plug.
            In this so-called “throttling” process, the change in internal energy of the mass is
            ∆E = E2 − E1 = E(T2, p2) − E(T1, p1). (6.167)
            However, the mass also does work. Let V1 and V2 be the upstream and downstream volume of the
            mass, respectively. The mass does the work p2 V2 in displacing gas on the downstream side of the
            plug, whereas the gas on the upstream side of the plug does the work p1 V1 on the mass. Thus, the
            net work done by the mass is
            W = p2 V2 − p1 V1. (6.168)
            No heat is absorbed by the mass of gas in the throttling process that we have just described.
            This is not just because the walls of the pipe are thermally insulated, so that no heat enters from
            the outside. More importantly, after a steady-state has been achieved, there is no temperature
            difference between the walls and the adjacent gas, so there is no heat flow from the walls to the
            gas. It follows that
            Q = 0. (6.169)
            Application of the first law of thermodynamics to the mass of gas yields
            ∆E + W = Q = 0, (6.170)
            102 6.16. Joule-Thompson Throttling
            or
            (E2 − E1) + (p2 V2 − p1 V1) = 0, (6.171)
            where use has been made of Equations (6.167) and (6.168). Now, the enthalpy of the gas mass is
            defined
            H = E + p V. (6.172)
            (See Section 6.10.) Hence, we deduce that
            H2 = H1, (6.173)
            or
            H(T2, p2) = H(T1, p1). (6.174)
            In other words, the gas passes through the porous plug in such a manner that its enthalpy remains
            constant.
            Suppose that H(T, p) is a known function of T and p. In this case, given T1 and p1, as well
            as the downstream pressure, p2, Equation (6.174) allows the downstream temperature, T2, to be
            determined. In the case of an ideal gas,
            H = E + p V = E(T) + ν R T, (6.175)
            so that H = H(T) is a function of the temperature only. Thus, Equation (6.174) reduces to
            H(T2) = H(T1), (6.176)
            which implies that T2 = T1. Thus, the temperature of an ideal gas does not change in a throttling
            process.
            For the case of a real gas, the parameter that controls whether the gas is heated or cooled in a
            throttling process is
            µ =

            ∂p
            
            H
            . (6.177)
            This parameter is known as the Joule-Thompson coefficient. Given that p decreases in a throttling
            process, a positive Joule-Thompson coefficient implies that the temperature also decreases, and
            vice versa. Let us derive a convenient expression for µ in term of readily measured experimental
            parameters. Starting from the fundamental thermodynamic relation [see Equation (6.5)]
            dE = T dS − p dV, (6.178)
            we find that
            dH = d(E + p V) = T dS + V dp. (6.179)
            For the case of throttling, dH = 0. Thus, we can write

            Consider a van der Waals gas. The van der Waals equation of state, (6.156), can be written in
            the reduced form

            These equations define a curve in the p-T plane, known as the inversion curve, that is shown in
            Figure 6.2. (Also shown, for comparison, is the experimental inversion curve of nitrogen.) To
            the left of the curve, µ > 0, and the gas is cooled by a throttling process. Conversely, to the
            right of the curve, µ < 0, and the gas is heated by a throttling process. The maximum possible
            inversion temperature is (Tinv)max = (27/4) Tc. Thus, using the data in Table 6.2, we would predict
            that the maximum inversion temperatures of helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen are 35 K,
            224 K, 852 K, and 1044 K, respectively. In fact, the experimentally determined maximum inversion
            temperatures are 34 K, 202 K, 625 K, and 760 K, respectively. Thus, our estimate is fairly accurate
            in the case of helium, but becomes increasingly less accurate as the atomic weight of the gas
            increases. This is merely a deficiency in the van der Waals model.
            The so-called Joule-Thompson throttling process, just described, can be used to cool nitrogen
            and oxygen to very low temperatures, starting from room temperature, because the maximum
            inversion temperatures of these two gases both exceed room temperature. On the other hand, an
            attempt to cool helium gas starting from room temperature would result in an increase, rather than
            a decrease, in the gas temperature (because room temperature exceeds the maximum inversion
            temperature). Thus, in order to use the Joule-Thompson process to cool helium gas to very low
            temperatures, it is first necessary to pre-cool the gas to a temperature that is less than 34 K. This
            can be achieved using liquid hydrogen.
            6.17 Heat Engines
            Thermodynamics was invented, almost by accident, in 1825, by a young French engineer called
            Sadi Carnot, who was investigating the theoretical limitations on the efficiency of steam engines.
            Although, nowadays, we are not particularly interested in steam engines, it is still highly instructive to review some of Carnot’s arguments. We know, by observation, that it is possible to do
            mechanical work w upon a device M, and then to extract an equivalent amount of heat q, which
            Classical Thermodynamics 105
            goes to increase the internal energy of some heat reservoir. (Here, we use the small letters w and q
            to denote intrinsically positive amounts of work and heat, respectively.) An good example of this
            process is Joule’s classic experiment by which he verified the first law of thermodynamics. A paddle wheel is spun in a liquid by a falling weight, and the work done by the weight on the wheel is
            converted into heat, and absorbed by the liquid. Carnot’s question was the following. Is it possible
            to reverse this process, and build a device, called a heat engine, that extracts heat energy from a
            reservoir, and converts it into useful macroscopic work? For instance, is it possible to extract heat
            from the ocean, and use it to run an electric generator?
            There are a few caveats to Carnot’s question. First of all, the work should not be done at the
            expense of the heat engine itself, otherwise the conversion of heat into work could not continue
            indefinitely. We can ensure that this is the case by demanding that the heat engine perform some
            sort of cycle, by which it periodically returns to the same macrostate, but, in the meantime, has
            extracted heat from the reservoir, and done an equivalent amount of useful work. A cyclic process
            seems reasonable, because we know that both steam engines and internal combustion engines
            perform continuous cycles. The second caveat is that the work done by the heat engine should be
            such as to change a single parameter of some external device (e.g., by lifting a weight), without
            doing it at the expense of affecting the other degrees of freedom, or the entropy, of that device. For
            instance, if we are extracting heat from the ocean to generate electricity, we want to spin the shaft
            of the electrical generator without increasing the generator’s entropy—that is, without causing the
            generator to heat up, or fall to bits.
            Let us examine the feasibility of a heat engine using the laws of thermodynamics. Suppose
            that a heat engine, M, performs a single cycle. Because M has returned to its initial macrostate, its
            internal energy is unchanged, and the first law of thermodynamics tell us that the work done by the
            engine, w, must equal the heat extracted from the reservoir, q, so that
            w = q. (6.191)
            The previous condition is certainly a necessary condition for a feasible heat engine. But, is it
            also a sufficient condition? In other words, does every device that satisfies this condition actually
            work? Let us think a little more carefully about what we are actually expecting a heat engine
            to do. We want to construct a device that will extract energy from a heat reservoir, where it is
            randomly distributed over very many degrees of freedom, and convert it into energy distributed
            over a single degree of freedom associated with some parameter of an external device. Once we
            have expressed the problem in these terms, it is fairly obvious that what we are really asking for is
            a spontaneous transition from a probable to an improbable state, which we know is forbidden by
            the second law of thermodynamics. So, unfortunately, we cannot run an electric generator off heat
            extracted from the ocean, because this is equivalent to expecting all of the molecules in the ocean,
            which are moving in random directions, to all suddenly all move in the same direction, so as to
            exert a force on some lever, say, that can then be converted into a torque on the generator shaft.
            We know, from our investigation of statistical thermodynamics, that such a process—although, in
            principle, possible—is fantastically improbable.
            The improbability of the scenario just outlined is summed up in the second law of thermodynamics, which says that the total entropy of an isolated system can never spontaneously decrease,
            106 6.17. Heat Engines
            so
            ∆S ≥ 0. (6.192)
            For the case of a heat engine, the isolated system consists of the engine, the reservoir from which it
            extracts heat, and the outside device upon which it does work. The engine itself returns periodically
            to the same state, so its entropy is clearly unchanged after each cycle. We have already specified
            that there is no change in the entropy of the external device upon which the work is done. On the
            other hand, the entropy change per cycle of the heat reservoir, which is held at absolute temperature
            T1, say, is given by
            ∆S reservoir =
            ! dQ¯
            T1
            = − q
            T1
            , (6.193)
            where ¯dQ is the infinitesimal heat absorbed by the reservoir, and the integral is taken over a whole
            cycle of the heat engine. The integral can be converted into the expression −q/T1 because the
            amount of heat extracted by the engine is assumed to be too small to modify the temperature of the
            reservoir (which is the definition of a heat reservoir), so that T1 is a constant during the cycle. The
            second law of thermodynamics reduces to
            −q
            T1
            ≥ 0 (6.194)
            or, making use of the first law of thermodynamics,
            q
            T1
            = w
            T1
            ≤ 0. (6.195)
            Because we wish the work, w, done by the engine to be positive, the previous relation clearly cannot
            be satisfied, which proves that an engine that converts heat directly into work is thermodynamically
            impossible.
            A perpetual motion device, which continuously executes a cycle without extracting heat from,
            or doing work on, its surroundings, is possible according to Equation (6.195). In fact, such a device
            corresponds to the equality sign in Equation (6.192), which implies that the device must be completely reversible. In reality, there is no such thing as a completely reversible engine. All engines,
            even the most efficient, have frictional losses that render them, at least, slightly irreversible. Thus,
            the equality sign in Equation (6.192) corresponds to an asymptotic limit that reality can closely
            approach, but never quite attain. It follows that a perpetual motion device is thermodynamically
            impossible. Nevertheless, the US patent office receives about 100 patent applications a year regarding perpetual motion devices. The British patent office, being slightly less open-minded that
            its American counterpart, refuses to entertain such applications on the basis that perpetual motion
            devices are forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics.
            According to Equation (6.195), there is no thermodynamic objection to a heat engine that runs
            backwards, and converts work directly into heat. This is not surprising, because we know that
            this is essentially what frictional forces do. Clearly, we have, here, another example of a natural
            process that is fundamentally irreversible according to the second law of thermodynamics. In fact,
            the statement
            It is impossible to construct a perfect heat engine that converts heat directly into work
            Classical Thermodynamics 107
            is called Kelvin’s formulation of the second law.
            We have demonstrated that a perfect heat engine, that converts heat directly into work, is impossible. But, there must be some way of obtaining useful work from heat energy, otherwise steam
            engines would not operate. The reason that our previous scheme did not work was that it decreased
            the entropy of a heat reservoir, held at some temperature T1, by extracting an amount of heat q per
            cycle, without any compensating increase in the entropy of anything else, so the second law of
            thermodynamics was violated. How can we remedy this situation? We still want the heat engine
            itself to perform periodic cycles (so, by definition, its entropy cannot increase over a cycle), and
            we also do not want to increase the entropy of the external device upon which the work is done.
            Our only other option is to increase the entropy of some other body. In Carnot’s analysis, this other
            body is a second heat reservoir held at temperature T2. We can increase the entropy of the second
            reservoir by dumping some of the heat that we extracted from the first reservoir into it. Suppose
            that the heat per cycle that we extract from the first reservoir is q1, and the heat per cycle that we
            reject into the second reservoir is q2. Let the work done on the external device be w per cycle. The
            first law of thermodynamics implies that
            q1 = w + q2. (6.196)
            Note that if q2 < q1 then positive (i.e., useful) work is done on the external device. The total entropy
            change per cycle is a consequence of the heat extracted from the first reservoir, and the heat dumped
            into the second, and must be positive (or zero), according to the second law of thermodynamics.
            So,
            ∆S = −q1
            T1
            + q2
            T2
            ≥ 0. (6.197)
            We can combine the previous two equations to give
            −q1
            T1
            + q1 − w
            T2
            ≥ 0, (6.198)
            or
            w

            T1
            
            . (6.199)
            It is clear that the engine is only going to perform useful work (i.e., w is only going to be positive)
            if T2 < T1. So, the second reservoir must be colder than the first if the heat dumped into the former
            is to increase the entropy of the universe more than the heat extracted from the latter decreases it. It
            is useful to define the efficiency, η, of a heat engine. This is the ratio of the work done per cycle on
            the external device to the heat energy absorbed per cycle from the first reservoir. The efficiency of
            a perfect heat engine is unity, but we have already shown that such an engine is impossible. What
            is the efficiency of a realizable engine? It is clear, from the previous equation, that
            η ≡
            w
            q1
            ≤ 1 − T2
            T1
            = T1 − T2
            T1
            . (6.200)
            Note that the efficiency is always less than unity. A real engine must always reject some energy
            into the second heat reservoir, in order to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics, so less energy
            108 6.17. Heat Engines
            is available to do external work, and the efficiency of the engine is reduced. The equality sign
            in the previous expression corresponds to a completely reversible heat engine (i.e., one that is
            quasi-static). It is clear that real engines, which are always irreversible to some extent, are less
            efficient than reversible engines. Furthermore, all reversible engines that operate between the two
            temperatures T1 and T2 have the same efficiency,
            η = T1 − T2
            T1
            , (6.201)
            irrespective of the manner in which they operate.
            Let us consider how we might construct a reversible heat engine. Suppose that we have some
            gas in a cylinder equipped with a frictionless piston. The gas is not necessarily a perfect gas.
            Suppose that we also have two heat reservoirs held at temperatures T1 and T2 (where T1 > T2).
            These reservoirs might take the form of large water baths. Let us start off with the gas in thermal
            contact with the first reservoir. We now pull the piston out, very slowly, so that heat energy flows
            reversibly into the gas from the reservoir. Let us now thermally isolate the gas, and slowly pull
            out the piston some more. During this adiabatic process, the temperature of the gas falls (because
            there is no longer any heat flowing into it to compensate for the work it does on the piston). Let us
            continue this process until the temperature of the gas falls to T2. We now place the gas in thermal
            contact with the second reservoir, and slowly push the piston in. During this isothermal process,
            heat flows out of the gas into the reservoir. We next thermally isolate the gas a second time, and
            slowly compress it some more. In this process, the temperature of the gas increases. We stop the
            compression when the temperature reaches T1. If we carry out each step properly then we can
            return the gas to its initial state, and then repeat the cycle ad infinitum. We now have a set of
            reversible processes by which a quantity of heat is extracted from the first reservoir, and a quantity
            of heat is dumped into the second. We can best evaluate the work done by the system during
            each cycle by plotting out the locus of the gas in a p-V diagram. The locus takes the form of a
            closed curve. See Figure 6.3. The net work done per cycle is the “area” enclosed within this curve,
            because ¯dW = p dV [if p is plotted vertically, and V horizontally, then p dV is clearly an element
            of area under the curve p(V)]. The engine we have just described is called a Carnot engine, and is
            the simplest conceivable device capable of converting heat energy into useful work.
            For the specific case of an ideal gas, we can actually calculate the work done per cycle, and,
            thereby, verify Equation (6.201). Consider the isothermal expansion phase of the gas. For an ideal
            gas, the internal energy is a function of the temperature alone. The temperature does not change
            during isothermal expansion, so the internal energy remains constant, and the net heat absorbed by
            the gas must equal the work it does on the piston. Thus,
            q1 =
             b
            a
            p dV, (6.202)
            where the expansion takes the gas from state a to state b. Because p V = ν R T, for an ideal gas,
            we have
            q1 =
             b
            a
            ν R T1
            dV
            V = ν R T1 ln

            Figure 6.3: An ideal-gas Carnot engine.
            Likewise, during the isothermal compression phase, in which the gas goes from state c to state d,
            the net heat rejected to the second reservoir is
            q2 = ν R T2 ln 
            Vc
            Vd
            
            . (6.204)
            Now, during adiabatic expansion, or compression,
            T V γ−1 = constant. (6.205)
            It follows that, during the adiabatic expansion phase, which takes the gas from state b to state c,
            T1 V γ−1
            b = T2 V γ−1 c . (6.206)
            Likewise, during the adiabatic compression phase, which takes the gas from state d to state a,
            T1 V γ−1 a = T2 V γ−1
            d . (6.207)
            If we take the ratio of the previous two equations then we obtain
            Vb
            Va
            = Vc
            Vd
            . (6.208)
            Hence, the work done by the engine, which we can calculate using the first law of thermodynamics,
            w = q1 − q2, (6.209)
            is
            w = ν R (T1 − T2) ln 
            Vb
            Va
            
            . (6.210)
            110 6.18. Refrigerators
            Thus, the efficiency of the engine is
            η = w
            q1
            = T1 − T2
            T1
            (6.211)
            which, not surprisingly, is identical to Equation (6.201).
            The engine described previously is very idealized. Of course, real engines are far more complicated than this. Nevertheless, the maximum efficiency of an ideal heat engine places severe
            constraints on real engines. Conventional power stations have many different “front ends” (e.g.,
            coal fired furnaces, oil fired furnaces, nuclear reactors), but their “back ends” are all very similar,
            and consist of a steam driven turbine connected to an electric generator. The “front end” heats
            water extracted from a local river (say), and turns it into steam, which is then used to drive the
            turbine, and, hence, to generate electricity. Finally, the steam is sent through a heat exchanger, so
            that it can heat up the incoming river water, which means that the incoming water does not have
            to be heated so much by the “front end.” At this stage, some heat is rejected to the environment,
            usually as clouds of steam escaping from the top of cooling towers. We can see that a power station
            possesses many of the same features as our idealized heat engine. There is a cycle that operates
            between two temperatures. The upper temperature is the temperature to which the steam is heated
            by the “front end,” and the lower temperature is the temperature of the environment into which
            heat is rejected. Suppose that the steam is only heated to 100◦ C (or 373 K), and the temperature of
            the environment is 15◦ C (or 288 K). It follows from Equation (6.200) that the maximum possible
            efficiency of the steam cycle is
            η = 373 − 288
            373  0.23. (6.212)
            So, at least 77% of the heat energy generated by the “front end” goes straight up the cooling towers.
            Not surprisingly, commercial power stations do not operate with 100◦ C steam. The only way in
            which the thermodynamic efficiency of the steam cycle can be raised to an acceptable level is to
            use very hot steam (clearly, we cannot refrigerate the environment). Using 400◦ C steam, which is
            not uncommon, the maximum efficiency becomes
            η = 673 − 288
            673  0.57, (6.213)
            which is more reasonable. In fact, the steam cycles of modern power stations are so well designed
            that they come surprisingly close to their maximum thermodynamic efficiencies.
            6.18 Refrigerators
            Let us now consider refrigerators. An idealized refrigerator is an engine that extracts heat from
            a cold heat reservoir (held at temperature T2, say), and rejects it into a somewhat hotter heat
            reservoir, which is usually the environment (held at temperature T1, say). To make this engine
            work, we always have to do some external work on the engine. For instance, the refrigerator in
            your home contains a small electric pump that does work on the freon in the cooling circuit. We
            can see that, in fact, a refrigerator is just a heat engine run in reverse. Hence, we can immediately
            Classical Thermodynamics 111
            carry over most of our heat engine analysis. Let q2 be the heat absorbed per cycle from the colder
            reservoir, q1 the heat rejected per cycle into the hotter reservoir, and w the external work done per
            cycle on the engine. The first law of thermodynamics implies that
            w + q2 = q1. (6.214)
            The second law says that
            q1
            T1
            + −q2
            T2
            ≥ 0. (6.215)
            We can combine these two laws to give
            w
            T1
            ≥ q2

            − 1
            T1
            
            . (6.216)
            The most sensible way of defining the efficiency of a refrigerator is as the ratio of the heat extracted
            per cycle from the cold reservoir to the work done per cycle on the engine. With this definition
            η = T2
            T1 − T2
            . (6.217)
            We can see that this efficiency is, in general, greater than unity. In other words, for one joule of
            work done on the engine, or pump, more than one joule of energy is extracted from whatever it is
            we are cooling. Clearly, refrigerators are intrinsically very efficient devices. Domestic refrigerators
            cool stuff down to about 4◦ C (277 K), and reject heat to the environment at about 15◦ C (288 K).
            The maximum theoretical efficiency of such devices is
            η = 277
            288 − 277 = 25.2. (6.218)
            So, for every joule of electricity we put into a refrigerator, we can extract up to 25 joules of heat
            from its contents.

            6.3 A cylindrical container 80 cm long is separated into two compartments by a thin piston,
            originally clamped in position 30 cm from the left end. The left compartment is filled with
            one mole of helium gas at a pressure of 5 atmospheres; the right compartment is filled with
            argon gas at 1 atmosphere of pressure. The gases may be considered ideal. The cylinder is
            submerged in 1 liter of water, and the entire system is initially at the uniform temperature
            of 25◦ C (with the previously mentioned pressures in the two compartments). The heat
            capacities of the cylinder and piston may be neglected. When the piston is unclamped, a
            new equilibrium situation is ultimately reached with the piston in a new position.
            (a) What is the increase in temperature of the water?
            (b) How far from the left end of the cylinder will the piston come to rest?
            (c) What is the increase in total entropy of the system?
            One atmosphere is equivalent to 105 N m−2
            . Absolute zero is −273◦ C. The specific heat of
            water is 4.18 joules/degree/gram. The density of water is 1 g/cm3.
            6.4 A vertical cylinder contains ν moles of an ideal gas, and is closed off by a piston of mass
            M and area A. The acceleration due to gravity is g. The molar specific heat cV (at constant
            volume) of the gas is a constant independent of temperature. The heat capacities of the
            piston and cylinder are negligibly small, and any frictional forces between the piston and
            the cylinder walls can be neglected. The pressure of the atmosphere can also be neglected.
            The whole system is thermally insulated. Initially, the piston is clamped in position so that
            the gas has a volume V0, and a temperature T0. The piston is now released, and, after some
            oscillations, comes to rest in a final equilibrium situation corresponding to a larger volume
            of gas.
            (a) Does the temperature of the gas increase, decrease, or remain the same?
            (b) Does the entropy of the gas increase, decrease, or remain the same?
            (c) Show that the final temperature of the gas is

            6.5 The following describes a method used to measure the specific heat ratio, γ ≡ cp/cV, of
            a gas. The gas, assumed ideal, is confined within a vertical cylindrical container, and
            supports a freely-moving piston of mass m. The piston and cylinder both have the same
            cross-sectional area A. Atmospheric pressure is p0, and when the piston is in equilibrium
            under the influence of gravity (acceleration g) and the gas pressure, the volume of the gas
            is V0. The piston is now displaced slightly from its equilibrium position, and is found to
            oscillate about this position at the angular frequency ω. The oscillations of the piston are
            sufficiently slow that the gas always remains in internal equilibrium, but fast enough that
            Classical Thermodynamics 113
            the gas cannot exchange heat with its environment. The variations in gas pressure and
            volume are therefore adiabatic. Show that
            γ = ω2 m V0
            m g A + p0 A2 .
            6.6 When sound passes through a fluid (liquid or gas), the period of vibration is short compared to the relaxation time necessary for a macroscopically small element of the fluid to
            exchange energy with the rest of the fluid through heat flow. Hence, compressions of such
            an element of volume can be considered adiabatic.
            By analyzing one-dimensional compressions and rarefactions of the system of fluid contained in a slab of thickness dx, show that the pressure, p(x, t), in the fluid depends on the
            position, x, and the time, t, so as to satisfy the wave equation

            a → b: Adiabatic compression (compression stroke).
            b → c: Isochoric (i.e., constant volume) increase of temperature during ignition. (Gas
            combustion is an irreversible process. Here, it is replaced by a reversible isochoric
            process in which heat is assumed to flow into the system from a reservoir.)

            (b) Calculate η for the realistic values r = 5 and γ = 1.5.
            Note: Because γ > 1, maximizing r maximizes the engine efficiency. The maximum practical value of r is about 7. For greater values, the rise in temperature during compression
            is large enough to cause ignition prior to the advent of the spark. This process is called
            pre-ignition, and is deleterious to the operation of the engine. Pre-ignition is not a problem
            for diesel engines (which depend on spontaneous ignition, rather than triggering ignition
            via a spark), so higher compression ratios are possible. This is partly the reason that diesel
            engines are inherently more efficient than gasoline engines.

            7 Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics
            7.1 Introduction
            In our study of classical thermodynamics, we concentrated on the application of statistical physics
            to macroscopic systems. Somewhat paradoxically, statistical arguments did not figure very prominently in this investigation. The resolution of this paradox is, of course, that macroscopic systems
            contain a very large number of particles, and their statistical fluctuations are, therefore, negligible.
            Let us now apply statistical physics to microscopic systems, such as atoms and molecules. In this
            study, the underlying statistical nature of thermodynamics will become far more apparent.
            7.2 Canonical Probability Distribution
            We have gained some understanding of the macroscopic properties of the air in a classroom (say).
            For instance, we know something about its internal energy and specific heat capacity. How can we
            obtain information about the statistical properties of the molecules that make up this air? Consider
            a specific molecule. It constantly collides with its immediate neighbor molecules, and occasionally
            bounces off the walls of the room. These interactions “inform” it about the macroscopic state of the
            air, such as its temperature, pressure, and volume. The statistical distribution of the molecule over
            its own particular microstates must be consistent with this macrostate. In other words, if we have
            a large group of such molecules with similar statistical distributions then they must be equivalent
            to air with the appropriate macroscopic properties. So, it ought to be possible to calculate the
            probability distribution of the molecule over its microstates from a knowledge of these macroscopic
            properties.
            We can think of the interaction of a molecule with the air in a classroom as analogous to the
            interaction of a small system, A, in thermal contact with a heat reservoir, A
            . The air acts like a heat
            reservoir because its energy fluctuations due to interactions with the molecule are far too small to
            affect any of its macroscopic parameters. Let us determine the probability, Pr, of finding system A
            in one particular microstate, r, of energy Er, when it is thermal equilibrium with the heat reservoir,
            A
            .
            As usual, we assume fairly weak interaction between A and A
            , so that the energies of these
            two systems are additive. The energy of A is not known at this stage. In fact, only the total energy
            of the combined system, A(0) = A + A
            , is known. Suppose that the total energy lies in the range
            E (0) to E (0) + δE. The overall energy is constant in time, because A(0) is assumed to be an isolated
            system, so
            Er + E = E (0), (7.1)
            where E denotes the energy of the reservoir A
            . Let Ω
            (E
            ) be the number of microstates accessible
            to the reservoir when its energy lies in the range E to E + δE. Clearly, if system A has an energy
            Er then the reservoir A must have an energy close to E = E (0) − Er. Hence, because A is in
            one definite state (i.e., state r), and the total number of states accessible to A is Ω
            (E (0) − Er), it
            118 7.2. Canonical Probability Distribution
            follows that the total number of states accessible to the combined system is simply Ω
            (E (0) − Er).
            The principle of equal a priori probabilities tells us the probability of occurrence of a particular
            situation is proportional to the number of accessible microstates. Thus,
            Pr = C Ω
            (E (0) − Er), (7.2)
            where C is a constant of proportionality that is independent of r. This constant can be determined
            by the normalization condition
            
            r
            Pr = 1, (7.3)
            where the sum is over all possible states of system A, irrespective of their energy.
            Let us now make use of the fact that system A is far smaller than system A
            . It follows that
            Er  E (0), so the slowly-varying logarithm of Pr can be Taylor expanded about E = E (0). Thus,
            ln Pr = lnC + ln Ω
            (E (0)) −
            
            ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E
            
            0
            Er + ··· . (7.4)
            Note that we must expand ln Pr, rather than Pr itself, because the latter function varies so rapidly
            with energy that the radius of convergence of its Taylor series is too small for the series to be of any
            practical use. The higher-order terms in Equation (7.4) can be safely neglected, because Er  E (0).
            Now, the derivative
            
            ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E
            
            0
            ≡ β (7.5)
            is evaluated at the fixed energy E = E (0), and is, thus, a constant, independent of the energy,
            Er, of A. In fact, we know, from Chapter 5, that this derivative is just the temperature parameter
            β = (k T)
            −1 characterizing the heat reservoir A
            . Here, T is the absolute temperature of the reservoir.
            Hence, Equation (7.4) becomes
            ln Pr = lnC + ln Ω
            (E (0)) − β Er, (7.6)
            giving
            Pr = C exp(−β Er), (7.7)
            where C is a constant independent of r. The parameter C is determined by the normalization
            condition, which gives
            C−1 =
            
            r
            exp(−β Er), (7.8)
            so that the distribution becomes
            Pr = exp(−β Er)
            
            r exp(−β Er)
            . (7.9)
            This distribution is known as the canonical probability distribution (it is also sometimes called the
            Boltzmann probability distribution), and is an extremely important result in statistical physics.
            The canonical distribution often causes confusion. People who are familiar with the principle
            of equal a priori probabilities, which says that all microstates are equally probable, are understandably surprised when they come across the canonical distribution, which says that high energy
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 119
            microstates are markedly less probable then low energy states. However, there is no need for any
            confusion. The principle of equal a priori probabilities applies to the whole system, whereas the
            canonical distribution only applies to a small part of the system. The two results are perfectly
            consistent. If the small system is in a microstate with a comparatively high energy, Er, then the
            remainder of the system (i.e., the reservoir) has a slightly lower energy, E
            , than usual (because the
            overall energy is fixed). The number of accessible microstates of the reservoir is a very strongly
            increasing function of its energy. It follows that if the small system has a high energy then significantly less states than usual are accessible to the reservoir, so the number of microstates accessible
            to the overall system is reduced, and, hence, the configuration is comparatively unlikely. The
            strong increase in the number of accessible microstates of the reservoir with increasing E gives
            rise to the strong (i.e., exponential) decrease in the likelihood of a state r of the small system with
            increasing Er. The exponential factor exp(−β Er) is called the Boltzmann factor.
            The canonical distribution gives the probability of finding the small system A in one particular
            state r of energy Er. The probability P(E) that A has an energy in the small range between E and
            E + δE is just the sum of all the probabilities of the states that lie in this range. However, because
            each of these states has approximately the same Boltzmann factor, this sum can be written
            P(E) = C Ω(E) exp(−β E), (7.10)
            where Ω(E) is the number of microstates of A whose energies lie in the appropriate range. Suppose
            that system A is itself a large system, but still very much smaller than system A
            . For a large system,
            we expect Ω(E) to be a very rapidly increasing function of energy, so the probability P(E) is the
            product of a rapidly increasing function of E, and another rapidly decreasing function (i.e., the
            Boltzmann factor). This gives a sharp maximum of P(E) at some particular value of the energy.
            As system A becomes larger, this maximum becomes sharper. Eventually, the maximum becomes
            so sharp that the energy of system A is almost bound to lie at the most probable energy. As usual,
            the most probable energy is evaluated by looking for the maximum of ln P, so
            ∂ ln P
            ∂E = ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E − β = 0, (7.11)
            giving
            ∂ ln Ω
            ∂E = β. (7.12)
            Of course, this corresponds to the situation in which the temperature of A is the same as that of
            the reservoir. This is a result that we have seen before. (See Chapter 5.) Note, however, that the
            canonical distribution is applicable no matter how small system A is, so it is a far more general
            result than any that we have previously obtained.
            7.3 Spin-1/2 Paramagnetism
            The simplest microscopic system that we can analyze using the canonical probability distribution
            is one that has only two possible states. (There would clearly be little point in analyzing a system
            with only one possible state.) Most elements, and some compounds, are paramagnetic. In other
            120 7.3. Spin-1/2 Paramagnetism
            words, their constituent atoms, or molecules, possess a permanent magnetic moment due to the
            presence of one or more unpaired electrons. Consider a substance whose constituent particles
            contain only one unpaired electron (with zero orbital angular momentum). Such particles have spin
            1/2 [i.e., their spin angular momentum is (1/2) ], and consequently possess an intrinsic magnetic
            moment, µ. According to quantum mechanics, the magnetic moment of a spin-1/2 particle can
            point either parallel or antiparallel to an external magnetic field, B. Let us determine the mean
            magnetic moment (parallel to B), µ, of the constituent particles of the substance when its absolute
            temperature is T. We shall assume, for the sake of simplicity, that each atom (or molecule) only
            interacts weakly with its neighboring atoms. This enables us to focus attention on a single atom,
            and to treat the remaining atoms as a heat bath at temperature T.
            Our atom can be in one of two possible states. Namely, the (+) state in which its spin points up
            (i.e., parallel to B), or the (−) state in which its spin points down (i.e., antiparallel to B). In the (+)
            state, the atomic magnetic moment is parallel to the magnetic field, so that µ = µ. The magnetic
            energy of the atom is + = −µ B. In the (−) state, the atomic magnetic moment is antiparallel to
            the magnetic field, so that µ = −µ. The magnetic energy of the atom is − = µ B.
            According to the canonical distribution, the probability of finding the atom in the (+) state is
            P+ = C exp(−β +) = C exp( β µ B), (7.13)
            where C is a constant, and β = (k T)
            −1. Likewise, the probability of finding the atom in the (−)
            state is
            P− = C exp(−β −) = C exp(−β µ B). (7.14)
            Clearly, the most probable state is the state with the lower energy [i.e., the (+) state]. Thus, the
            mean magnetic moment points in the direction of the magnetic field (i.e., the atomic spin is more
            likely to point parallel to the field than antiparallel).
            It is apparent that the critical parameter in a paramagnetic system is
            y ≡ β µ B = µ B
            k T . (7.15)
            This parameter measures the ratio of the typical magnetic energy of the atom, µ B, to its typical
            thermal energy, k T. If the thermal energy greatly exceeds the magnetic energy then y  1, and the
            probability that the atomic moment points parallel to the magnetic field is about the same as the
            probability that it points antiparallel. In this situation, we expect the mean atomic moment to be
            small, so that µ  0. On the other hand, if the magnetic energy greatly exceeds the thermal energy
            then y 
             1, and the atomic moment is far more likely to be directed parallel to the magnetic field
            than antiparallel. In this situation, we expect µ  µ.
            Let us calculate the mean atomic moment, µ. The usual definition of a mean value gives
            µ = P+ µ + P− (−µ)
            P+ + P−
            = µ

            exp( β µ B) − exp(−β µ B)
            exp( β µ B) + exp(−β µ B)
            
            . (7.16)
            This can also be written
            µ = µ tanh 
            
            µ B

            , (7.17)
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 121
            where the hyperbolic tangent is defined
            tanh y ≡
            exp( y) − exp(−y)
            exp( y) + exp(−y)
            . (7.18)
            For small arguments, y  1,
            tanh y  y − y 3

            µ  µ2B
            k T , (7.21)
            whereas at comparatively low temperatures, k T  µ B,
            µ  µ. (7.22)
            Suppose that the substance contains N0 atoms (or molecules) per unit volume. The magnetization is defined as the mean magnetic moment per unit volume, and is given by
            M = N0 µ. (7.23)
            At high temperatures, k T 
             µ B, the mean magnetic moment, and, hence, the magnetization, is
            proportional to the applied magnetic field, so we can write
            M  χ
            B
            µ0
            , (7.24)
            where χ is a dimensionless constant of proportionality known as the magnetic susceptibility, and
            µ0 the magnetic permeability of free space. It is clear that the magnetic susceptibility of a spin-1/2
            paramagnetic substance takes the form
            χ = N0 µ0 µ2
            k T . (7.25)
            The fact that χ ∝ T −1 is known as Curie’s law, because it was discovered experimentally by Pierre
            Curie at the end of the nineteenth century. At low temperatures, k T  µ B,
            M → N0 µ, (7.26)
            so the magnetization becomes independent of the applied field. This corresponds to the maximum possible magnetization, in which all atomic moments are aligned parallel to the field. The
            breakdown of the M ∝ B law at low temperatures (or high magnetic fields) is known as saturation.
            122 7.4. System with Specified Mean Energy
            7.4 System with Specified Mean Energy
            Consider an isolated system, A, that consists of a fixed number of particles contained in a given
            volume. Suppose that the the only available information about the system’s energy is its mean
            value, E. This might be the case, for example, if the system is brought to some final macrostate as
            a result of interaction with other macroscopic systems. Here, the measurement of the macroscopic
            work done on the system, or the heat that it absorbs, during this process does not tell us about
            the energy of each system in the corresponding ensemble, but, instead, only provides information
            about the mean energy of the final macrostate of A.
            A system, A, with specified mean energy, E, is also described by a canonical distribution. For,
            if such a system were placed in thermal contact with a heat reservoir held at some “temperature,”
            β = 1/(k T), then the mean energy of the system would be determined. Thus, an appropriate choice
            of β would guarantee that the mean energy of the system had the specific value E.
            We can give a more direct proof of the previous assertion. Let Er be the energy of system A
            in some state r. Suppose that the statistical ensemble consists of a very large number, a, of such
            systems, ar of which are in state r. Thus, the information available to us is that
            1
            a
            
            s
            as Es = E. (7.27)
            Hence, it follows that
            
            s
            as Es = a E = constant. (7.28)
            This implies that the situation is equivalent to one in which a fixed amount of energy, a E, is to
            be distributed over all the systems in the ensemble, such that each system is equally likely to be
            in any one state. If a system in the ensemble is in state r then the remaining a − 1 systems must
            then have a combined energy E = a E − Er. These a − 1 systems are distributed over some very
            large number, Φ(E
            ), of accessible states. In other words, if the one system under consideration
            is in state r then the remaining a − 1 systems are distributed with equal probability in any of the
            Φ(a E−Er) states accessible to them. Because Er  a E, the mathematical problem here is exactly
            the same as that considered in Section 7.2, where we dealt with a system in thermal contact with a
            heat bath. In this case, the role of the heat bath is played by the totality of all the other systems in
            the ensemble. Accordingly, we again get the canonical distribution,
            Pr ∝ exp(−β Er). (7.29)
            The parameter β ≡ (∂ ln Φ/∂E
            ) does not here have any immediate physical significance in terms
            of the temperature of a real heat bath. Instead, it is to be determined by the condition that the mean
            energy calculated using the distribution has the specified value E. In other words,
            
            r exp(−β Er) Er 
            r exp(−β Er) = E. (7.30)
            In conclusion, if one is dealing with a system in contact with a heat bath held at “temperature”
            β = 1/(k T) then the canonical distribution, (7.29), is valid, and the mean energy, E, can be calculated from Equation (7.30), using the known value of β. On the other hand, if one is dealing with a
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 123
            system of specified mean energy, E, then the canonical distribution, (7.29), is again valid, but the
            parameter β is to be calculated using Equation (7.30) and the known value of E.
            7.5 Calculation of Mean Values
            Consider a system in contact with a heat reservoir, or with a specified mean energy. The systems
            in the representative ensemble are distributed over their accessible states in accordance with the
            canonical distribution. Thus, the probability of occurrence of some state r with energy Er is given
            by
            Pr = exp(−β Er)
            
            r exp(−β Er)
            . (7.31)
            The mean energy is written
            E =
            
            r exp(−β Er) Er 
            r exp(−β Er) , (7.32)
            where the sum is taken over all states of the system, irrespective of their energy. Note that
            
            r
            exp(−β Er) Er = −
            
            r
            ∂
            ∂β exp(−β Er) = −∂Z
            ∂β , (7.33)
            where
            Z =
            
            r
            exp(−β Er). (7.34)
            It follows that
            E = −1
            Z
            ∂Z
            ∂β = −∂ ln Z
            ∂β . (7.35)
            The quantity Z, which is defined as the sum of the Boltzmann factor over all states, irrespective of
            their energy, is called the partition function. (Incidentally, the partition function is represented by
            the symbol Z because in German it is known as the “zustandssumme,” which means the “sum over
            states.”) We have just demonstrated that it is fairly easy to work out the mean energy of a system
            using its partition function. In fact, as we shall discover, it is straightforward to calculate virtually
            any piece of statistical information from the partition function.
            Let us evaluate the variance of the energy. We know that
            (∆E) 2 = E 2 − E
            2
            . (7.36)
            (See Chapter 2.) Now, according to the canonical distribution,
            E 2 =
            
            r exp(−β Er) E 2
            r 
            r exp(−β Er) . (7.37)
            However,

            = −∂E
            ∂β + E
            2
            , (7.40)
            where use has been made of Equation (7.35). It follows from Equation (7.36) that
            (∆E) 2 = −∂E
            ∂β = ∂2 ln Z
            ∂β2 . (7.41)
            Thus, the variance of the energy can be worked out from the partition function almost as easily
            as the mean energy. Because, by definition, a variance can never be negative, it follows that
            ∂E/∂β ≤ 0, or, equivalently, ∂E/∂T ≥ 0. Hence, the mean energy of a system governed by the
            canonical distribution always increases with increasing temperature.
            Suppose that the system is characterized by a single external parameter x (such as its volume).
            The generalization to the case where there are several external parameters is straightforward. Consider a quasi-static change of the external parameter from x to x + dx. In this process, the energy
            of the system in state r changes by
            δEr = ∂Er
            ∂x
            dx. (7.42)
            The macroscopic work ¯dW done by the system due to this parameter change is
            dW¯ =
            
            r exp(−β Er) (−∂Er/∂x dx)
            
            r exp(−β Er) . (7.43)
            In other words, the work done is minus the average change in internal energy of the system, where
            the average is calculated using the canonical distribution. We can write
            
            r
            exp(−β Er)
            ∂Er

            ∂Z

            which gives
            dW¯ = 1

            ∂x

            We also have the following general expression for the work done by the system
            dW¯ = X dx, (7.46)
            where
            X = −∂Er
            ∂x
            (7.47)
            is the mean generalized force conjugate to x. (See Chapter 4.) It follows that

            ∂x . (7.48)
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 125
            Suppose that the external parameter is the volume, so x = V. It follows that

            ∂ ln Z
            ∂V , (7.50)
            where p is the pressure. Because the partition function is a function of β and V (the energies
            Er depend on V), it follows that the previous equation relates the mean pressure, p, to T (via
            β = 1/k T) and V. In other words, the previous expression is the equation of state. Hence, we can
            work out the pressure, and even the equation of state, using the partition function.
            7.6 Partition Function
            It is clear that all important macroscopic quantities associated with a system can be expressed
            in terms of its partition function, Z. Let us investigate how the partition function is related to
            thermodynamical quantities. Recall that Z is a function of both β and x (where x is the single
            external parameter). Hence, Z = Z(β, x), and we can write
            d ln Z = ∂ ln Z
            ∂x
            dx +
            ∂ ln Z
            ∂β dβ. (7.51)
            Consider a quasi-static change by which x and β change so slowly that the system stays close to
            equilibrium, and, thus, remains distributed according to the canonical distribution. It follows from
            Equations (7.35) and (7.45) that
            d ln Z = β dW¯ − E dβ. (7.52)
            The last term can be rewritten
            d ln Z = β dW¯ − d
            
            E β
            
            + β dE, (7.53)
            giving
            d
            
            ln Z + β E
            
            = β
            
            dW¯ + dE
            
            ≡ β dQ¯ . (7.54)
            The previous equation shows that although the heat absorbed by the system, ¯dQ, is not an exact
            differential, it becomes one when multiplied by the temperature parameter, β. This is essentially
            the second law of thermodynamics. In fact, we know that
            dS =dQ¯
            T . (7.55)
            Hence,
            S ≡ k
            
            ln Z + β E
            
            . (7.56)
            This expression enables us to calculate the entropy of a system from its partition function.
            126 7.7. Ideal Monatomic Gas
            Suppose that we are dealing with a system A(0) consisting of two systems A and A that only
            interact weakly with one another. Let each state of A be denoted by an index r, and have a corresponding energy Er. Likewise, let each state of A be denoted by an index s, and have a corresponding energy E
            s. A state of the combined system A(0) is then denoted by two indices r and s.
            Because A and A only interact weakly, their energies are additive, and the energy of state rs is
            E (0)
            rs = Er + E

            where Z and Z are the partition functions of A and A
            , respectively. It follows from Equation (7.35)
            that the mean energies of A(0), A, and A are related by
            E (0)
            = E + E
            
            . (7.61)
            It also follows from Equation (7.56) that the respective entropies of these systems are related via
            S (0) = S + S 
            . (7.62)
            Hence, the partition function tells us that the extensive (see Section 7.8) thermodynamic functions
            of two weakly-interacting systems are simply additive.
            It is clear that we can perform statistical thermodynamical calculations using the partition function, Z, instead of the more direct approach in which we use the density of states, Ω. The former
            approach is advantageous because the partition function is an unrestricted sum of Boltzmann factors taken over all accessible states, irrespective of their energy, whereas the density of states is a
            restricted sum taken over all states whose energies lie in some narrow range. In general, it is far
            easier to perform an unrestricted sum than a restricted sum. Thus, it is invariably more straightforward to derive statistical thermodynamical results using Z rather than Ω, although Ω has a far
            more direct physical significance than Z.
            7.7 Ideal Monatomic Gas
            Let us now practice calculating thermodynamic relations using the partition function by considering an example with which we are already quite familiar: namely, an ideal monatomic gas.
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 127
            Consider a gas consisting of N identical monatomic molecules of mass m, enclosed in a container
            of volume V. Let us denote the position and momentum vectors of the ith molecule by ri and
            pi, respectively. Because the gas is ideal, there are no interatomic forces, and the total energy is
            simply the sum of the individual kinetic energies of the molecules:
            E =
            
            i=1,N
            p2
            i
            2 m, (7.63)
            where p2
            i = pi ·pi.
            Let us treat the problem classically. In this approach, we divide up phase-space into cells
            of equal volume h f
            0 . Here, f is the number of degrees of freedom, and h0 is a small constant
            with dimensions of angular momentum that parameterizes the precision to which the positions and
            momenta of molecules are determined. (See Section 3.2.) Each cell in phase-space corresponds
            to a different state. The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factor exp(−β Er) taken
            over all possible states, where Er is the energy of state r. Classically, we can approximate the
            summation over cells in phase-space as an integration over all phase-space. Thus,
            Z =
            
            ··· 
            exp(−β E)
            d 3r1 ··· d 3rN d 3p1 ··· d 3pN
            h3N
            0
            , (7.64)
            where 3N is the number of degrees of freedom of a monatomic gas containing N molecules. Making use of Equation (7.63), the previous expression reduces to
            Z = V N
            h3N
            0
            

            d 3
            pN. (7.65)
            Note that the integral over the coordinates of a given molecule simply yields the volume of the
            container, V, because the energy, E, is independent of the locations of the molecules in an ideal
            gas. There are N such integrals, so we obtain the factor V N in the previous expression. Note, also,
            that each of the integrals over the molecular momenta in Equation (7.65) are identical: they differ
            only by irrelevant dummy variables of integration. It follows that the partition function Z of the
            gas is made up of the product of N identical factors: that is,
            Z = ζ N, (7.66)
            where
            ζ = V
            h3

            d 3
            p (7.67)
            is the partition function for a single molecule. Of course, this result is obvious, because we have
            already shown that the partition function for a system made up of a number of weakly interacting
            subsystems is just the product of the partition functions of the subsystems. (See Section 7.6.)

            p V = NkT = ν R T, (7.72)
            where use has been made of N = ν NA and R = NA k. According to Equation (7.35), the mean
            energy of the gas is given by
            E = −∂ ln Z

            Note that the internal energy is a function of temperature alone, with no dependence on volume.

            cV = 1

            We have seen all of the previous results before. Let us now use the partition function to calculate a new result. The entropy of the gas can be calculated quite simply from the expression

            The previous expression for the entropy of an ideal gas is certainly a new result. Unfortunately, it
            is also quite obviously incorrect.
            7.8 Gibb’s Paradox
            First of all, let us be clear why Equation (7.78) is incorrect.
            We can see that S → −∞ as T → 0, which contradicts the third law of thermodynamics.
            However, this is not a problem. Equation (7.78) was derived using classical physics, which breaks
            down at low temperatures. Thus, we would not expect this equation to give a sensible answer close
            to the absolute zero of temperature.
            Equation (7.78) is wrong because it implies that the entropy does not behave properly as an
            extensive quantity. Thermodynamic quantities can be divided into two groups; extensive and intensive. Extensive quantities increase by a factor α when the size of the system under consideration
            is increased by the same factor. Intensive quantities stay the same. Energy and volume are typical extensive quantities. Pressure and temperature are typical intensive quantities. Entropy is
            very definitely an extensive quantity. We have previously shown that the entropies of two weaklyinteracting systems are additive. [See Equation (7.62).] Thus, if we double the size of a system
            then we expect the entropy to double as well. Suppose that we have a system of volume V, containing ν moles of ideal gas at temperature T. Doubling the size of the system is like joining two
            identical systems together to form a new system of volume 2 V, containing 2 ν moles of gas at
            temperature T. Let
            S = ν R
            
            ln V +
            3

            ln(2 V) +

            
            (7.81)
            denote the entropy of the double-sized system. Clearly, if entropy is an extensive quantity then we
            should have
            S  = 2 S. (7.82)
            But, in fact, we find that
            S  − 2 S = 2 ν R ln 2. (7.83)
            130 7.8. Gibb’s Paradox
            So, the entropy of the double-sized system is more than double the entropy of the original system.
            Where does this extra entropy come from? Let us consider a little more carefully how we might
            go about doubling the size of our system. Suppose that we put another identical system adjacent
            to it, and separate the two systems by a partition. Let us now suddenly remove the partition. If
            entropy is a properly extensive quantity then the entropy of the overall system should be the same
            before and after the partition is removed. It is certainly the case that the energy (another extensive
            quantity) of the overall system stays the same. However, according to Equation (7.83), the overall
            entropy of the system increases by 2 ν R ln 2 after the partition is removed. Suppose, now, that
            the second system is identical to the first system in all respects, except that its molecules are in
            some way slightly different to the molecules in the first system, so that the two sets of molecules
            are distinguishable. In this case, we would certainly expect an overall increase in entropy when
            the partition is removed. Before the partition is removed, it separates type 1 molecules from type
            2 molecules. After the partition is removed, molecules of both types become jumbled together.
            This is clearly an irreversible process. We cannot imagine the molecules spontaneously sorting
            themselves out again. The increase in entropy associated with this jumbling is called entropy of
            mixing, and is easily calculated. We know that the number of accessible states of an ideal gas varies
            with volume like Ω ∝ V N. The volume accessible to type 1 molecules clearly doubles after the
            partition is removed, as does the volume accessible to type 2 molecules. Using the fundamental
            formula S = k ln Ω, the increase in entropy due to mixing is given by
            S = 2 k ln 
            Ωf
            Ωi

            Vf
            Vi
            
            = 2 ν R ln 2. (7.84)
            It is clear that the additional entropy, 2 ν R ln 2, that appears when we double the size of an
            ideal gas system, by joining together two identical systems, is entropy of mixing of the molecules
            contained in the original systems. But, if the molecules in these two systems are indistinguishable
            then why should there be any entropy of mixing? Obviously, there is no entropy of mixing in this
            case. At this point, we can begin to understand what has gone wrong in our calculation. We have
            calculated the partition function assuming that all of the molecules in our system have the same
            mass and temperature, but we have not explicitly taken into account the fact that we consider the
            molecules to be indistinguishable. In other words, we have been treating the molecules in our ideal
            gas as if each carried a little license plate, or a social security number, so that we could always
            tell one from another. In quantum mechanics, which is what we really should be using to study
            microscopic phenomena, the essential indistinguishability of atoms and molecules is hard-wired
            into the theory at a very low level. Our problem is that we have been taking the classical approach a
            little too seriously. It is plainly nonsense to pretend that we can distinguish molecules in a statistical
            problem where we cannot closely follow the motions of individual particles. A paradox arises if
            we try to treat molecules as if they were distinguishable. This is called Gibb’s paradox, after the
            American physicist Josiah Gibbs, who first discussed it. The resolution of Gibb’s paradox is quite
            simple: treat all molecules of the same species as if they were indistinguishable.
            In our previous calculation of the ideal gas partition function, we inadvertently treated each of
            the N molecules in the gas as distinguishable. Because of this, we over-counted the number of
            states of the system. Because the N! possible permutations of the molecules amongst themselves
            do not lead to physically different situations, and, therefore, cannot be counted as separate states,
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 131
            the number of actual states of the system is a factor N! less than what we initially thought. We can
            easily correct our partition function by simply dividing by this factor, so that
            Z = ζ N
            N!
            . (7.85)
            This gives
            ln Z = N ln ζ − ln N!, (7.86)
            or
            ln Z = N ln ζ − N ln N + N, (7.87)
            using Stirling’s approximation. Note that our new version of ln Z differs from our previous version
            by an additive term involving the number of particles in the system. This explains why our calculations of the mean pressure and mean energy, which depend on partial derivatives of ln Z with
            respect to the volume and the temperature parameter β, respectively, came out all right. However,
            our expression for the entropy S is modified by this additive term. The new expression is

            It is clear that the entropy behaves properly as an extensive quantity in Equation (7.89). In other

            In Section 7.3, we considered the special case of paramagnetism in which all the atoms that make
            up the substance under investigation possess spin 1/2. Let us now discuss the general case.
            Consider a system consisting of N non-interacting atoms in a substance held at absolute temperature T, and placed in an external magnetic field, B = Bz ez, that points in the z-direction. The
            magnetic energy of a given atom is written
             = −µ · B, (7.91)
            where µ is the atom’s magnetic moment. Now, the magnetic moment of an atom is proportional to
            its total electronic angular momentum,  J. In fact,
            µ = g µB J, (7.92)
            132 7.9. General Paramagnetism
            where
            µB = e 
            2 me
            (7.93)
            is a standard unit of magnetic moment known as the Bohr magneton. Here, e is the magnitude of
            the electron charge, and me the electron mass. Moreover, g is a dimensionless number of order
            unity that is called the g-factor of the atom.
            Combining Equations (7.91) and (7.92), we obtain
             = −g µB J · B = −g µB Bz Jz. (7.94)
            Now, according to standard quantum mechanics,
            Jz = m, (7.95)
            where m is an integer that can take on all values between −J and +J. Here, |J| = J (J + 1), where
            J is a positive number that can either take integer or half-integer values. Thus, there are 2 J + 1
            allowed values of m, corresponding to different possible projections of the angular momentum
            vector along the z-direction. It follows from Equation (7.94) that the possible magnetic energies of
            an atom are
            m = −g µB Bz m. (7.96)
            For example, if J = 1/2 (corresponding to a spin-1/2 system) then there are only two possible
            energies, corresponding to m = ±1/2. This was the situation considered in Section 7.3. (To be
            more exact, a spin-1/2 system corresponds to J = 1/2 and g = 2.)
            The probability, Pm, that an atom is in a state labeled m is
            Pm ∝ exp(−β m) = exp( βgµB Bz m), (7.97)
            where β = 1/(k T). According to Equation (7.92), the corresponding z-component of the magnetic
            moment is
            µz = g µB m. (7.98)
            Hence, the mean z-component of the magnetic moment is
            µz =
            
            m=−J,+J exp( βgµB Bz m) g µB m
            
            m=−J,+J exp( βgµB Bz m) . (7.99)
            The numerator in the previous expression is conveniently expressed as a derivative with respect to
            the external parameter Bz:
            
            m=−J,+J
            exp( βgµB Bz m) g µB m = 1
            β
            ∂Za
            ∂Bz
            , (7.100)
            where
            Za =
            
            m=−J,+J
            exp( βgµB Bz m) (7.101)
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 133
            is the partition function of a single atom. Thus, Equation (7.99) becomes
            µz = 1

            ∂ ln Za
            ∂Bz
            . (7.102)
            In order to calculate Za, it is convenient to define
            η = βgµB Bz = g µB Bz
            k T , (7.103)
            which is a dimensionless parameter that measures the ratio of the magnetic energy, g µB Bz, that
            acts to align the atomic magnetic moments parallel to the external magnetic field, to the thermal
            energy, k T, that acts to keep the magnetic moment randomly orientated. Thus, Equation (7.101)
            becomes
            Za =
            
            m=−J,+J
            exp(m η) = e−η J 
            k=0,2J
            [exp(η)] k
            . (7.104)
            The previous geometric series can be summed to give
            Za = e−η J
            #
            1 − [exp(η)] 2J+1
            1 − exp(η)
            $
            . (7.105)
            (See Exercise 7.1.) Multiplying the numerator and denominator by exp(−η/2), we obtain
            Za = exp[−η (J + 1/2)] + exp[ η (J + 1/2)]
            exp(−η/2) − exp( η/2) , (7.106)
            or
            Za = sinh[(J + 1/2) η]
            sinh(η/2) , (7.107)
            where the hyperbolic sine is defined
            sinh z ≡
            exp( y) − exp(−y)
            2 . (7.108)
            Thus,
            ln Za = ln sinh[(J + 1/2) η] − ln sinh(η/2). (7.109)
            According to Equations (7.102) and (7.103),
            µz = 1
            β
            ∂ ln Za
            ∂Bz

            = g µB
            ∂ ln Za
            ∂η . (7.110)
            Hence,
            µz = g µB

            If there are N0 atoms per unit volume then the mean magnetic moment per unit volume (or

            where use has been made of Equation (7.112). If η  1 then Equation (7.119) implies that Mz ∝

            3 k T , (7.122)
            is known as the magnetic susceptibility. Thus, χ ∝ T −1—a result that is called Curie’s law. (See
            Section 7.3.) If η 
             1 then
            Mz → N0 g µB J. (7.123)
            This corresponds to magnetic saturation—a situation in which each atom has the maximum component of the magnetic moment parallel to the magnetic field, g µB J, that it can possibly have.
            Figure 7.2 compares the experimental and theoretical magnetization versus field-strength curves
            for three different paramagnetic substances containing atoms of total angular momentum 3/2, 5/2,
            and 7/2 particles, showing excellent agreement between theory and experiment. Note that, in all
            cases, the magnetization is proportional to the magnetic field-strength at small field-strengths, but
            saturates at some constant value as the field-strength increases.
            The previous analysis completely neglects any interaction between the spins of neighboring
            atoms or molecules. It turns out that this is a fairly good approximation for paramagnetic substances. However, for ferromagnetic substances, in which the spins of neighboring atoms interact
            very strongly, this approximation breaks down completely. (See Section 7.17.) Thus, the previous
            analysis does not apply to ferromagnetic substances.
            7.10 Equipartition Theorem
            The internal energy of a monatomic ideal gas containing N particles is (3/2) NkT. This means
            that each particle possess, on average, (3/2) k T units of energy. Monatomic particles have only
            three translational degrees of freedom, corresponding to their motion in three dimensions. They
            possess no internal rotational or vibrational degrees of freedom. Thus, the mean energy per degree
            of freedom in a monatomic ideal gas is (1/2) k T. In fact, this is a special case of a rather general
            result. Let us now try to prove this.
            Suppose that the energy of a system is determined by f generalized coordinates, qk, and f
            corresponding generalized momenta, pk, so that
            E = E(q1, ··· , qf , p1, ··· , pf). (7.124)
            Suppose further that:
            1. The total energy splits additively into the form
            E = i(pi) + E
            (q1, ··· , pf), (7.125)
            where i involves only one variable, pi, and the remaining part, E
            , does not depend on pi.
            2. The function i is quadratic in pi, so that
            i(pi) = b p2
            i , (7.126)
            where b is a constant.
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 137
            The most common situation in which the previous assumptions are valid is where pi is a momentum. This is because the kinetic energy is usually a quadratic function of each momentum
            component, whereas the potential energy does not involve the momenta at all. However, if a coordinate, qi, were to satisfy assumptions 1 and 2 then the theorem that we are about to establish
            would hold just as well.
            What is the mean value of i in thermal equilibrium if conditions 1 and 2 are satisfied? If the
            system is in equilibrium at absolute temperature T ≡ (k β)
            −1 then it is distributed according to the
            canonical probability distribution. In the classical approximation, the mean value of i is expressed
            in terms of integrals over all phase-space:
            i =
             ∞
            −∞ exp[−β E(q1, ··· , pf)]i dq1 ··· d pf
             ∞
            −∞ exp[−β E(q1, ··· , pf)] dq1 ··· d pf
            . (7.127)
            Condition 1 gives
            i =
             ∞
            −∞ exp[−β (i + E
            )]i dq1 ··· d pf

            −∞ exp[−β (i + E
            )] dq1 ··· d pf
            =

            −∞ exp(−β i)i d pi

            −∞ exp(−β E
            ) dq1 ··· d pf
             ∞
            −∞ exp(−β i) d pi
             ∞
            −∞ exp(−β E
            ) dq1 ··· d pf
            , (7.128)
            where use has been made of the multiplicative property of the exponential function, and where the
            final integrals in both the numerator and denominator extend over all variables, qk and pk, except
            for pi. These integrals are equal and, thus, cancel. Hence,
            i =
             ∞
            −∞ exp(−β i)i d pi
             ∞
            −∞ exp(−β i) d pi

            This expression can be simplified further because

            This is the famous equipartition theorem of classical physics. It states that the mean value of
            every independent quadratic term in the energy is equal to (1/2) k T. If all terms in the energy are
            quadratic then the mean energy is spread equally over all degrees of freedom. (Hence, the name
            “equipartition.”)
            7.11 Harmonic Oscillators
            Our proof of the equipartition theorem depends crucially on the classical approximation. To see
            how quantum effects modify this result, let us examine a particularly simple system that we know
            how to analyze using both classical and quantum physics: namely, a simple harmonic oscillator. Consider a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator in equilibrium with a heat reservoir held at
            absolute temperature T. The energy of the oscillator is given by
            E = p2
            2 m
            +
            1
            2 κ x 2
            , (7.136)
            where the first term on the right-hand side is the kinetic energy, involving the momentum, p, and
            the mass, m, and the second term is the potential energy, involving the displacement, x, and the
            force constant, κ. Each of these terms is quadratic in the respective variable. So, in the classical
            approximation, the equipartition theorem yields:
            p2
            2 m = 1
            2
            k T, (7.137)

            κ x 2 = 1
            2
            k T. (7.138)
            That is, the mean kinetic energy of the oscillator is equal to the mean potential energy, which
            equals (1/2) k T. It follows that the mean total energy is
            E = 1
            2 k T +
            1
            2 k T = k T. (7.139)
            According to quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator are equally spaced,
            and satisfy

            Thus, the classical result, (7.139), holds whenever the thermal energy greatly exceeds the typical
            spacing between quantum energy levels.

            β ω = ω

            Thus, if the thermal energy is much less than the spacing between quantum states then the mean
            energy approaches that of the ground-state (the so-called zero-point energy). Clearly, the equipartition theorem is only valid in the former limit, where k T 
             ω, and the oscillator possess sufficient
            thermal energy to explore many of its possible quantum states.
            7.12 Specific Heats
            We have discussed the internal energies and entropies of substances (mostly ideal gases) at some
            length. Unfortunately, these quantities cannot be directly measured. Instead, they must be inferred
            from other information. The thermodynamic property of substances that is the easiest to measure
            is, of course, the heat capacity, or specific heat. In fact, once the variation of the specific heat with
            temperature is known, both the internal energy and entropy can be easily reconstructed via
            E(T, V) = ν
             T
            0
            cV(T, V) dT + E(0, V), (7.156)
            S (T, V) = ν
             T
            0
            cV(T, V)
            T
            dT. (7.157)
            Here, use has been made of dS = dQ¯ /T, and the third law of thermodynamics. Clearly, the
            optimum way of verifying the results of statistical thermodynamics is to compare the theoretically
            predicted heat capacities with the experimentally measured values.
            Classical physics, in the guise of the equipartition theorem, says that each independent degree
            of freedom associated with a quadratic term in the energy possesses an average energy (1/2) k T
            in thermal equilibrium at temperature T. Consider a substance made up of N molecules. Every
            molecular degree of freedom contributes (1/2) NkT, or (1/2) ν R T, to the mean energy of the
            substance (with the tacit proviso that each degree of freedom is associated with a quadratic term
            in the energy). Thus, the contribution to the molar heat capacity at constant volume (we wish to
            avoid the complications associated with any external work done on the substance) is
            1
            ν

            per molecular degree of freedom. The total classical heat capacity is therefore
            cV = g
            2
            R, (7.159)
            where g is the number of molecular degrees of freedom. Because large complicated molecules
            clearly have very many more degrees of freedom than small simple molecules, the previous formula predicts that the molar heat capacities of substances made up of the former type of molecules
            should greatly exceed those of substances made up of the latter. In fact, the experimental heat
            capacities of substances containing complicated molecules are generally greater than those of
            substances containing simple molecules, but by nowhere near the large factor predicted in Equation (7.159). This equation also implies that heat capacities are temperature independent. In fact,
            this is not the case for most substances. Experimental heat capacities generally increase with increasing temperature. These two experimental facts pose severe problems for classical physics.
            Incidentally, these problems were fully appreciated as far back as 1850. Stories that physicists at
            the end of the nineteenth century thought that classical physics explained absolutely everything are
            largely apocryphal.
            The equipartition theorem (and the whole classical approximation) is only valid when the typical thermal energy, k T, greatly exceeds the spacing between quantum energy levels. Suppose that
            the temperature is sufficiently low that this condition is not satisfied for one particular molecular
            degree of freedom. In fact, suppose that k T is much less than the spacing between the energy
            levels. According to Section 7.11, in this situation, the degree of freedom only contributes the
            ground-state energy, E0 (say) to the mean energy of the molecule. Now, the ground-state energy
            can be a quite complicated function of the internal properties of the molecule, but is certainly not
            a function of the temperature, because this is a collective property of all molecules. It follows that
            the contribution to the molar heat capacity is
            1
            ν
            
            ∂[N E0]
            ∂T
            
            V
            = 0. (7.160)
            Thus, if k T is much less than the spacing between the energy levels then the degree of freedom
            contributes nothing at all to the molar heat capacity. We say that this particular degree of freedom
            is “frozen out.” Clearly, at very low temperatures, just about all degrees of freedom are frozen out.
            As the temperature is gradually increased, degrees of freedom successively kick in, and eventually
            contribute their full (1/2) R to the molar heat capacity, as k T approaches, and then greatly exceeds,
            the spacing between their quantum energy levels. We can use these simple ideas to explain the
            behaviors of most experimental heat capacities.
            To make further progress, we need to estimate the typical spacing between the quantum energy
            levels associated with various degrees of freedom. We can do this by observing the frequency of
            the electromagnetic radiation emitted and absorbed during transitions between these energy levels.
            If the typical spacing between energy levels is ∆E then transitions between the various levels are
            associated with photons of frequency ν, where h ν = ∆E. (Here, h is Planck’s constant.) We can
            define an effective temperature of the radiation via h ν = k Trad. If T 
             Trad then k T 
             ∆E, and the
            degree of freedom makes its full contribution to the heat capacity. On the other hand, if T  Trad
            then k T  ∆E, and the degree of freedom is frozen out. Table 7.1 lists the “temperatures” of

            absorption of radio or microwave radiation contribute their full (1/2) R to the molar heat capacity at
            room temperature. On the other hand, degrees of freedom that give rise to emission or absorption
            in the visible, ultraviolet, X-ray, or γ-ray regions of the electromagnetic spectrum are frozen out
            at room temperature. Degrees of freedom that emit or absorb infrared radiation are on the border
            line.
            7.13 Specific Heats of Gases
            Let us now investigate the specific heats of gases. Consider, first of all, translational degrees of
            freedom. Every molecule in a gas is free to move in three dimensions. If one particular molecule
            has mass m and momentum p = m v then its kinetic energy of translation is
            K = 1
            2 m
            
            p2
            x + p2
            y + p2
            z
            
            . (7.161)
            The kinetic energy of other molecules does not involve the momentum, p, of this particular
            molecule. Moreover, the potential energy of interaction between molecules depends only on their
            position coordinates, and is, thus, independent of p. Any internal rotational, vibrational, electronic, or nuclear degrees of freedom of the molecule also do not involve p. Hence, the essential
            conditions of the equipartition theorem are satisfied. (At least, in the classical approximation.)
            Because Equation (7.161) contains three independent quadratic terms, there are clearly three degrees of freedom associated with translation (one for each dimension of space), so the translational
            contribution to the molar heat capacity of gases is
            (cV)translation = 3
            2
            R. (7.162)
            Suppose that our gas is contained in a cubic enclosure of dimensions L. According to Schr¨odinger’s equation, the quantized translational energy levels of an individual molecule are given by
            E = 2 π2
            2 m L2
            
            n2
            1 + n2
            2 + n2
            3
            
            , (7.163)
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 143
            where n1, n2, and n3 are positive integer quantum numbers. (See Appendix C.) Clearly, the spacing between the energy levels can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the size of the enclosure. This implies that translational degrees of freedom can be treated classically, so that Equation (7.162) is always valid. (Except very close to absolute zero.) We conclude that all gases
            possess a minimum molar heat capacity of (3/2) R due to the translational degrees of freedom of
            their constituent molecules.
            The electronic degrees of freedom of gas molecules (i.e., the possible configurations of electrons orbiting the atomic nuclei) typically give rise to absorption and emission in the ultraviolet or
            visible regions of the spectrum. It follows from Table 7.1 that electronic degrees of freedom are
            frozen out at room temperature. Similarly, nuclear degrees of freedom (i.e., the possible configurations of protons and neutrons in the atomic nuclei) are frozen out because they are associated
            with absorption and emission in the X-ray and γ-ray regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In
            fact, the only additional degrees of freedom that we need worry about for gases are rotational and
            vibrational degrees of freedom. These typically give rise to absorption lines in the infrared region
            of the spectrum.
            The rotational kinetic energy of a molecule tumbling in space can be written

            mutually perpendicular), Lx, Ly, and Lz are the angular momenta about these axes, and Ix, Iy, and
            Iz are the moments of inertia about these axes. No other degrees of freedom depend on the angular
            momenta. Because the kinetic energy of rotation is the sum of three quadratic terms, the rotational
            contribution to the molar heat capacity of gases is

            according to the equipartition theorem. Note that the typical magnitude of a molecular moment
            of inertia is m d 2
            , where m is the molecular mass, and d is the typical interatomic spacing in the
            molecule. A special case arises if the molecule is linear (e.g., if the molecule is diatomic). In this
            case, one of the principal axes lies along the line of centers of the atoms. The moment of inertia
            about this axis is of order m a2, where a is a typical nuclear dimension (remember that nearly all
            of the mass of an atom resides in the nucleus). Because a ∼ 10 −5 d, it follows that the moment of
            inertia about the line of centers is minuscule compared to the moments of inertia about the other
            two principle axes. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized in units of . The
            energy levels of a rigid rotator spinning about a principal axis are written

            inverse dependence of the spacing between energy levels on the moment of inertia. It is clear that,
            for the case of a linear molecule, the rotational degree of freedom associated with spinning along

            the line of centers of the atoms is frozen out at room temperature, given the very small moment of
            inertia along this axis, and, hence, the very widely spaced rotational energy levels.
            Classically, the vibrational degrees of freedom of a molecule are studied by standard normal
            mode analysis of the molecular structure. Each normal mode behaves like an independent harmonic oscillator, and, therefore, contributes R to the molar specific heat of the gas [(1/2) R from
            the kinetic energy of vibration, and (1/2) R from the potential energy of vibration]. A molecule
            containing n atoms has n − 1 normal modes of vibration. For instance, a diatomic molecule has
            just one normal mode (corresponding to periodic stretching of the bond between the two atoms).
            Thus, the classical contribution to the specific heat from vibrational degrees of freedom is
            (cV )vibration = (n − 1) R. (7.167)
            So, do any of the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom actually make a contribution to
            the specific heats of gases at room temperature, once quantum effects have been taken into consideration? We can answer this question by examining just one piece of data. Figure 7.3 shows the
            infrared absorption spectrum of hydrogen chloride gas. The absorption lines correspond to simultaneous transitions between different vibrational and rotational energy levels. Hence, this is usually
            called a vibration-rotation spectrum. The missing line at about 3.47 microns corresponds to a pure
            vibrational transition from the ground-state to the first excited state. (Pure vibrational transitions
            are forbidden—hydrogen chloride molecules always have to simultaneously change their rotational
            energy level if they are to couple effectively to electromagnetic radiation.) The longer wavelength
            absorption lines correspond to vibrational transitions in which there is a simultaneous decrease in
            the rotational energy level. Likewise, the shorter wavelength absorption lines correspond to vi-
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 145
            brational transitions in which there is a simultaneous increase in the rotational energy level. It is
            clear that the rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than the vibrational energy levels.
            The pure vibrational transition gives rise to absorption at about 3.47 microns, which corresponds
            to infrared radiation of frequency 8.5 × 1013 hertz with an associated radiation “temperature” of
            4,100 K. We conclude that the vibrational degrees of freedom of hydrogen chloride, or any other
            small molecule, are frozen out at room temperature. The rotational transitions split the vibrational
            lines by about 0.2 microns. This implies that pure rotational transitions would be associated with
            infrared radiation of frequency 5×1012 hertz and corresponding radiation “temperature” 240 K. We
            conclude that the rotational degrees of freedom of hydrogen chloride, or any other small molecule,
            are not frozen out at room temperature, and probably contribute the classical (1/2) R to the molar
            specific heat. There is one proviso, however. Linear molecules (like hydrogen chloride) effectively
            only have two rotational degrees of freedom (instead of the usual three), because of the very small
            moment of inertia of such molecules along the line of centers of the atoms.
            We are now in a position to make some predictions regarding the specific heats of various
            gases. Monatomic molecules only possess three translational degrees of freedom, so monatomic
            gases should have a molar heat capacity (3/2) R = 12.47 joules/degree/mole. Moreover, the ratio
            of specific heats γ = cp/cV = (cV + R)/cV should be 5/3 = 1.667. It can be seen from Table 6.1
            that both of these predictions are borne out pretty well for helium and argon. Diatomic molecules
            possess three translational degrees of freedom, and two rotational degrees of freedom. (All other
            degrees of freedom are frozen out at room temperature.) Thus, diatomic gases should have a molar
            heat capacity (5/2) R = 20.8 joules/degree/mole. Moreover, the ratio of specific heats should be
            7/5 = 1.4. It can be seen from Table 6.1 that these are reasonably accurate predictions for nitrogen
            and oxygen. The freezing out of vibrational degrees of freedom becomes gradually less effective as
            molecules become heavier and more complex. This is partly because such molecules are generally
            less stable, so the force constant, κ, is reduced, and partly because the molecular mass is increased.
            Both these effects reduce the frequency of vibration of the molecular normal modes [see Equation (7.141)], and, hence, the spacing between vibrational energy levels [see Equation (7.140)].
            This accounts for the obviously non-classical [i.e., not a multiple of (1/2) R] specific heats of carbon dioxide and ethane in Table 6.1. In both molecules, vibrational degrees of freedom contribute
            to the molar specific heat. (But not the full R, because the temperature is not sufficiently high.)
            Figure 7.4 shows the variation of the molar heat capacity at constant volume of gaseous molecular hydrogen (i.e., H2) with temperature. The expected contribution from the translational degrees
            of freedom is (3/2) R (there are three translational degrees of freedom per molecule). The expected
            contribution at high temperatures from the rotational degrees of freedom is R (there are effectively
            two rotational degrees of freedom per molecule). Finally, the expected contribution at high temperatures from the vibrational degrees of freedom is R (there is one vibrational degree of freedom
            per molecule). It can be seen that, as the temperature rises, the rotational, and then the vibrational,
            degrees of freedom eventually make their full classical contributions to the heat capacity.

            7.14 Specific Heats of Solids
            Consider a simple solid containing N atoms. Now, atoms in solids cannot translate (unlike those
            in gases), but are free to vibrate about their equilibrium positions. Such vibrations are termed
            lattice vibrations, and can be thought of as sound waves propagating through the crystal lattice.
            Each atom is specified by three independent position coordinates, and three conjugate momentum
            coordinates. Let us only consider small-amplitude vibrations. In this case, we can expand the
            potential energy of interaction between the atoms to give an expression that is quadratic in the
            atomic displacements from their equilibrium positions. It is always possible to perform a normal
            mode analysis of the oscillations. In effect, we can find 3N independent modes of oscillation of
            the solid. Each mode has its own particular oscillation frequency, and its own particular pattern
            of atomic displacements. Any general oscillation can be written as a linear combination of these
            normal modes. Let qi be the (appropriately normalized) amplitude of the ith normal mode, and pi
            the momentum conjugate to this coordinate. In normal-mode coordinates, the total energy of the
            lattice vibrations takes the particularly simple form
            E = 1

            , (7.168)
            where ωi is the (angular) oscillation frequency of the ith normal mode. It is clear that, when
            expressed in normal-mode coordinates, the linearized lattice vibrations are equivalent to 3N independent harmonic oscillators. (Of course, each oscillator corresponds to a different normal mode.)
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 147
            The typical value of ωi is the (angular) frequency of a sound wave propagating through the
            lattice. Sound wave frequencies are far lower than the typical vibration frequencies of gaseous
            molecules. In the latter case, the mass involved in the vibration is simply that of the molecule,
            whereas in the former case the mass involved is that of very many atoms (because lattice vibrations are non-localized). The strength of interatomic bonds in gaseous molecules is similar to
            those in solids, so we can use the estimate ω  √
            κ/m (κ is the force constant that measures the
            strength of interatomic bonds, and m is the mass involved in the oscillation) as proof that the typical frequencies of lattice vibrations are very much less than the vibration frequencies of simple
            molecules. It follows, from ∆E = ω, that the quantum energy levels of lattice vibrations are far
            more closely spaced than the vibrational energy levels of gaseous molecules. Thus, it is likely (and
            is, indeed, the case) that lattice vibrations are not frozen out at room temperature, but, instead,
            make their full classical contribution to the molar specific heat of the solid.
            If the lattice vibrations behave classically then, according to the equipartition theorem, each
            normal mode of oscillation has an associated mean energy k T, in equilibrium at temperature T
            [(1/2) k T resides in the kinetic energy of the oscillation, and (1/2) k T resides in the potential
            energy]. Thus, the mean internal energy per mole of the solid is
            E = 3 NkT = 3 ν R T. (7.169)
            It follows that the molar heat capacity at constant volume is

            = 3 R (7.170)
            for solids. This gives a value of 24.9 joules/mole/degree. In fact, at room temperature, most
            solids (in particular, metals) have heat capacities that lie remarkably close to this value. This fact
            was discovered experimentally by Dulong and Petite at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
            and was used to make some of the first crude estimates of the molecular weights of solids. (If
            we know the molar heat capacity of a substance then we can easily work out how much of it
            corresponds to one mole, and by weighing this amount, and then dividing the result by Avogadro’s
            number, we can then obtain an estimate of the molecular weight.) Table 7.2 lists the experimental
            molar heat capacities, cp, at constant pressure for various solids. The heat capacity at constant
            volume is somewhat less than the constant pressure value, but not by much, because solids are
            fairly incompressible. It can be seen that Dulong and Petite’s law (i.e., that all solids have a molar
            heat capacities close to 24.9 joules/mole/degree) holds pretty well for metals. However, the law
            fails badly for diamond. This is not surprising. As is well known, diamond is an extremely hard
            substance, so its interatomic bonds must be very strong, suggesting that the force constant, κ, is
            large. Diamond is also a fairly low-density substance, so the mass, m, involved in lattice vibrations
            is comparatively small. Both these facts suggest that the typical lattice vibration frequency of
            diamond (ω  √
            κ/m) is high. In fact, the spacing between the different vibrational energy levels
            (which scales like ω) is sufficiently large in diamond for the vibrational degrees of freedom to
            be largely frozen out at room temperature. This accounts for the anomalously low heat capacity of
            diamond in Table 7.2.

            Dulong and Petite’s law is essentially a high-temperature limit. The molar heat capacity cannot
            remain a constant as the temperature approaches absolute zero, because, by Equation (7.157), this
            would imply S → ∞, which violates the third law of thermodynamics. We can make a crude model
            of the behavior of cV at low temperatures by assuming that all of the normal modes oscillate at the
            same frequency, ω (say). This approximation was first employed by Einstein in a paper published
            in 1907. According to Equation (7.168), the solid acts like a set of 3N independent oscillators
            which, making use of Einstein’s approximation, all vibrate at the same frequency. We can use the
            quantum mechanical result (7.148) for a single oscillator to write the mean energy of the solid in

            So, in this simple model, the specific heat approaches zero exponentially as T → 0.
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 149
            In reality, the specific heats of solids do not approach zero quite as quickly as suggested by
            Einstein’s model when T → 0. The experimentally observed low-temperature behavior is more
            like cV ∝ T 3. (See Figure 7.6.) The reason for this discrepancy is the crude approximation that all
            normal modes have the same frequency. In fact, long-wavelength (i.e., low-frequency) modes have
            lower frequencies than short-wavelength (i.e., high-freqeuncy) modes, so the former are much
            harder to freeze out than the latter (because the spacing between quantum energy levels, ω, is
            smaller in the former case). The molar heat capacity does not decrease with temperature as rapidly
            as suggested by Einstein’s model because these long-wavelength modes are able to make a significant contribution to the heat capacity, even at very low temperatures. A more realistic model of
            lattice vibrations was developed by the Dutch physicist Peter Debye in 1912. In the Debye model,
            the frequencies of the normal modes of vibration are estimated by treating the solid as an isotropic
            continuous medium. This approach is reasonable because the only modes that really matter at low
            temperatures are the long-wavelength modes: more explicitly, those whose wavelengths greatly
            exceed the interatomic spacing. It is plausible that these modes are not particularly sensitive to the
            discrete nature of the solid. In other words, the fact that the solid is made up of atoms, rather than
            being continuous.
            Consider a sound wave propagating through an isotropic continuous medium. The disturbance
            varies with position vector r and time t like exp[−i (k· r − ωt)], where the wavevector, k, and the
            frequency of oscillation, ω, satisfy the dispersion relation for sound waves in an isotropic medium:
            ω = k cs. (7.177)
            Here, cs is the speed of sound in the medium. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that the medium
            is periodic in the x-, y-, and z-directions with periodicity lengths Lx, Ly, and Lz, respectively. In
            order to maintain periodicity, we need
            kx (x + Lx) = kx x + 2π nx, (7.178)
            where nx is an integer. There are analogous constraints on ky and kz. It follows that, in a periodic
            medium, the components of the wavevector are quantized, and can only take the values
            kx = 2π
            Lx
            nx, (7.179)

            the allowed values of the components of the wavevector are very closely spaced. For given values
            of ky and kz, the number of allowed values of kx that lie in the range kx to kx + dkx is given by
            ∆nx = Lx

            It follows that the number of allowed values of k (i.e., the number of allowed modes) when kx lies
            in the range kx to kx +dkx, ky lies in the range ky to ky +dky, and kz lies in the range kz to kz +dkz, is

            where V = Lx Ly Lz is the periodicity volume, and d 3k ≡ dkx dky dkz. The quantity ρ is called the
            density of modes. Note that this density is independent of k, and proportional to the periodicity
            volume. Thus, the density of modes per unit volume is a constant, independent of the magnitude,
            or shape, of the periodicity volume. The density of modes per unit volume when the magnitude of
            k lies in the range k to k + dk is given by multiplying the density of modes per unit volume by the
            “volume” in k-space of the spherical shell lying between radii k and k + dk. Thus,
            ρk dk = 4π k 2 dk
            (2π)3 = k 2
            2π2 dk. (7.184)
            Consider an isotropic continuous medium of volume V. According to the previous relation, the
            number of normal modes whose frequencies lie between ω and ω + dω (which is equivalent to the
            number of modes whose k values lie in the range ω/cs to ω/cs + dω/cs) is
            σc(ω) dω = 3 V ρk(k) dk

            The factor of 3 comes from the three possible polarizations of sound waves in solids. For every
            allowed wavenumber (or frequency), there are two independent torsional modes, where the displacement is perpendicular to the direction of propagation, and one longitudinal mode, where the
            displacement is parallel to the direction of propagation. Torsion waves are vaguely analogous to
            electromagnetic waves (these also have two independent polarizations). The longitudinal mode is
            very similar to the compressional sound wave in gases. Of course, torsion waves can not propagate
            in gases, because gases have no resistance to deformation without change of volume.
            The Debye approach consists in approximating the actual density of normal modes, σ(ω), by
            the density in a continuous medium, σc(ω), not only at low frequencies (long wavelengths) where
            these should be nearly the same, but also at higher frequencies where they may differ substantially.
            Suppose that we are dealing with a solid consisting of N atoms. We know that there are only 3N
            independent normal modes. It follows that we must cut off the density of states above some critical
            frequency, ωD (say), otherwise we will have too many modes. Thus, in the Debye approximation
            the density of normal modes takes the form
            σD(ω) =
            # σc(ω) ω<ωD
            0 ω>ωD
            . (7.186)
            Here, ωD is termed the Debye frequency, and is chosen such that the total number of normal modes
            is 3N:

            Thus, the Debye frequency depends only on the sound velocity in the solid, and the number of
            atoms per unit volume. The wavelength corresponding to the Debye frequency is 2π cs/ωD, which
            is clearly on the order of the interatomic spacing, a  (V/N) 1/3. It follows that the cut-off of normal
            modes whose frequencies exceed the Debye frequency is equivalent to a cut-off of normal modes
            whose wavelengths are less than the interatomic spacing. Of course, it makes physical sense that
            such modes should be absent.
            Figure 7.5 compares the actual density of normal modes in diamond with the density predicted
            by Debye theory. Not surprisingly, there is not a particularly strong resemblance between these
            two curves, because Debye theory is highly idealized. Nevertheless, both curves exhibit sharp cutoffs at high frequencies, and coincide at low frequencies. Furthermore, the areas under both curves
            are the same. As we shall see, this is sufficient to allow Debye theory to correctly account for the
            temperature variation of the specific heat of solids at low temperatures.

            We can use the quantum-mechanical expression for the mean energy of a single oscillator,

            The fact that cV goes like T 3 at low temperatures is quite well verified experimentally, although
            it is sometimes necessary to go to temperatures as low as 0.02 θD to obtain this asymptotic behavior.
            Theoretically, θD should be calculable from Equation (7.189) in terms of the sound speed in the
            solid, and the molar volume. Table 7.3 shows a comparison of Debye temperatures evaluated by
            this means with temperatures obtained empirically by fitting the law (7.201) to the low-temperature
            variation of the heat capacity. It can be seen that there is fairly good agreement between the
            theoretical and empirical Debye temperatures. This suggests that the Debye theory affords a good,
            though not perfect, representation of the behavior of cV in solids over the entire temperature range.
            Finally, Figure 7.6 shows the actual temperature variation of the molar heat capacities of various solids, as well as that predicted by Debye’s theory. The prediction of Einstein’s theory is also
            shown, for the sake of comparison.

            energy is due to molecular rotation, vibration, et cetera. Translational degrees of freedom can
            be treated classically to an excellent approximation, whereas internal degrees of freedom usually

            require a quantum-mechanical approach. Classically, the probability of finding the molecule in
            a given internal state with a position vector in the range r to r + dr, and a momentum vector
            in the range p to p + dp, is proportional to the number of cells (of “volume” h0) contained in
            the corresponding region of phase-space, weighted by the Boltzmann factor. In fact, because
            classical phase-space is divided up into uniform cells, the number of cells is just proportional to
            the “volume” of the region under consideration. This “volume” is written d 3r d 3p. Thus, the
            probability of finding the molecule in a given internal state s is

            p of
            finding the molecule in any internal state with position and momentum vectors in the specified
            range is obtained by summing the previous expression over all possible internal states. The sum
            over exp(−β int
            s ) just contributes a constant of proportionality (because the internal states do not
            depend on r or p), so

            Of course, we can multiply this probability by the total number of molecules, N, in order to obtain
            the mean number of molecules with position and momentum vectors in the specified range.
            Suppose that we now wish to determine f(r, v) d 3r d 3
            v: that is, the mean number of molecules
            with positions between r and r + dr, and velocities in the range v and v + dv. Because v = p/m, it
            is easily seen that

            In other word, the sum over molecules with all possible positions and velocities gives the total
            number of molecules, N. The integral over the molecular position coordinates just gives the volume, V, of the gas, because the Boltzmann factor is independent of position. The integration over
            the velocity coordinates can be reduced to the product of three identical integrals (one for vx, one
            for vy, and one for vz), so we have

            Here, n = N/V is the number density of the molecules. We have omitted the variable r in the
            argument of f , because f clearly does not depend on position. In other words, the distribution
            of molecular velocities is uniform in space. This is hardly surprising, because there is nothing to
            distinguish one region of space from another in our calculation. The previous distribution is called
            the Maxwell velocity distribution, because it was discovered by James Clark Maxwell in the middle
            of the nineteenth century. The average number of molecules per unit volume with velocities in the
            range v to v + dv is obviously f(v) d 3v.
            Let us consider the distribution of a given component of velocity: the z-component (say).
            Suppose that g(vz) dvz is the average number of molecules per unit volume with the z-component
            of velocity in the range vz to vz + dvz, irrespective of the values of their other velocity components.
            It is fairly obvious that this distribution is obtained from the Maxwell distribution by summing
            (integrating actually) over all possible values of vx and vy, with vz in the specified range. Thus,
            g(vz) dvz =

            g(vz) dvz = n. (7.213)
            It is clear that each component (because there is nothing special about the z-component) of
            the velocity is distributed with a Gaussian probability distribution (see Section 2.9), centered on a
            mean value
            vz = 0, (7.214)
            with variance
            v 2
            z = k T
            m . (7.215)
            Equation (7.214) implies that each molecule is just as likely to be moving in the plus z-direction as
            in the minus z-direction. Equation (7.215) can be rearranged to give

            in accordance with the equipartition theorem.
            Note that Equation (7.209) can be rewritten
            f(v) d 3
            v

            , (7.217)
            where g(vx) and g(vy) are defined in an analogous way to g(vz). Thus, the probability that the
            velocity lies in the range v to v+dv is just equal to the product of the probabilities that the velocity
            components lie in their respective ranges. In other words, the individual velocity components act
            like statistically-independent variables.
            Suppose that we now wish to calculate F(v) dv: that is, the average number of molecules per
            unit volume with a speed v = |v| in the range v to v + dv. It is obvious that we can obtain this
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 157
            quantity by summing over all molecules with speeds in this range, irrespective of the direction of
            their velocities. Thus,
            F(v) dv =
            
            f(v) d 3
            v, (7.218)
            where the integral extends over all velocities satisfying
            v < |v| < v + dv. (7.219)
            This inequality is satisfied by a spherical shell of radius v and thickness dv in velocity space.
            Because f(v) only depends on |v|, so f(v) ≡ f(v), the previous integral is just f(v) multiplied by
            the volume of the spherical shell in velocity space. So,
            F(v) dv = f(v) 4π v 2 dv, (7.220)
            which gives
            F(v) dv = 4π n

            This is the famous Maxwell distribution of molecular speeds. Of course, it is properly normalized,
            so that
             ∞
            0
            F(v) dv = n. (7.222)
            Note that the Maxwell distribution exhibits a maximum at some non-zero value of v. The reason for
            this is quite simple. As v increases, the Boltzmann factor decreases, but the volume of phase-space
            available to the molecule (which is proportional to v 2) increases: the net result is a distribution
            with a non-zero maximum.
            The mean molecular speed is given by
            v = 1

            then Equation (7.228) follows immediately. It is easily demonstrated that the most probable molecular speed (i.e., the maximum of the Maxwell distribution function) is
            v˜ =
            2 k T

            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 159
            because p = nkT and ρ = n m. It is clear that the various average speeds that we have just calculated are all of order the sound speed (i.e., a few hundred meters per second at room temperature).
            In ordinary air (γ = 1.4) the sound speed is about 84% of the most probable molecular speed, and
            about 74% of the mean molecular speed. Because sound waves ultimately propagate via molecular
            motion, it makes sense that they travel at slightly less than the most probable and mean molecular
            speeds.
            Figure 7.7 shows the Maxwell velocity distribution as a function of molecular speed in units of
            the most probable speed. Also shown are the mean speed and the root-mean-square speed.
            7.16 Effusion
            Consider a dilute gas enclosed in a container. Let us calculate how many molecules per unit time
            strike a unit area of the container wall.
            Consider a wall element of area dA. The z-axis is oriented so as to point along the outward
            normal of this element. Let v represent a molecular velocity. The Cartesian components of this
            velocity are conveniently written v = v(sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ), where the standard spherical
            angles θ and φ specify the velocity vector’s direction. Let us concentrate on those molecules, in the
            immediate vicinity of the wall element, whose velocities are such that they lie between v and v+dv.
            In other words, the velocities are such that their magnitudes lies between v and v + dv, their polar
            angles lie between θ and θ +dθ, and their azimuthal angles lie between φ and φ +dφ. Molecules of
            this type suffer a displacement v dt in the infinitesimal time interval dt. Hence, all molecules that
            lie within the infinitesimal cylinder of cross-sectional area dA, and length v dt (whose axis subtends
            an angle θ with the z-axis, and whose two ends are parallel to the wall element), will strike the wall
            element within the time interval dt, whereas those molecules outside this cylinder will not. (See
            Figure 7.8.) The volume of the cylinder is dA v cos θ dt, whereas the number of molecules per unit
            volume in the prescribed velocity range is f(v) d 3
            v. Hence, the number of molecules of this type
            that strike the area dA in the time interval dt is [f(v) d 3v] (dA v cos θ dt). Dividing this expression
            by the area dA, and the time interval dt, we obtain Φ(v) d 3v, which is defined as the number of
            molecules, with velocities in the range v to v + dv, that strike a unit area of the wall per unit time.
            Thus,
            Φ(v) d 3
            v = f(v)v cos θ d 3
            v. (7.233)
            Let Φ0 be the total number of molecules that strike a unit area of the wall per unit time. This
            quantity is simply obtained by summing (7.233) over all possible molecular velocities that would
            cause molecules to collide with the element of area. This means that we have to sum over all
            possible speeds, 0 <v< ∞, all possible azimuthal angles, 0 <φ< 2π, and all polar angles in
            the range 0 < θ < π/2. (Those molecules with polar angles in the range π/2 <θ<π have their
            velocity directed away from the wall, and will, hence, not collide with it.) In other words, we
            have to sum over all possible velocities, v, subject to the restriction that the velocity component
            vz = v cos θ is positive. Thus, we have
            Φ0 =

            v = v 2 dv(sin θ dθ dφ), (7.235)
            where sin θ dθ dφ = dΩ is just an element of solid angle. Moreover, in thermal equilibrium, f(v) =
            f(v) is only a function of |v|. Hence, Equation (7.234) becomes
            Φ0 =

            vz>0

            If a sufficiently small hole is made in the wall of the container then the equilibrium of the gas
            inside the container is disturbed to a negligible extent. [In practice, a sufficiently small hole is one
            that is small compared to the molecular mean-free-path (i.e., the mean distance travelled between
            collisions) inside the container.] In this case, the number of molecules that emerge through the
            small hole is the same as the number of molecules that would strike the area occupied by the hole
            if the latter were closed off. The process by which molecules emerge through a small hole is called
            effusion. The number of molecules that have speeds in the range between v and v + dv, and which
            emerge through a small hole of area A, into the solid angle range dΩ, in the forward direction
            θ = 0, is given by

            can be verified indirectly by measuring the velocity distribution of atoms effusing from a small
            hole in an oven. As we have just seen, the predicted velocity distribution of the escaping atoms
            varies like v 3 exp(−m v 2/2 k T), in contrast to the v 2 exp(−m v 2/2 k T) variation of the velocity distribution inside the oven. There is good agreement between the experimentally measured velocity
            distribution of effusing atoms and the theoretical prediction.
            As another example, consider a container that is divided into two parts by a partition containing
            a small hole. The container is filled with gas, but one part of the container is maintained at the
            temperature T1, and the other at the temperature T2. Let us calculate the relationship between the
            mean gas pressures, ¯p1 and ¯p2, respectively, in the two parts, when the system is in equilibrium.
            (That is, when a situation is reached in which neither ¯p1 or ¯p2, nor the amount of gas in either parts,
            changes with time.) If the hole is larger than the molecular mean-free-path then the relationship is
            simply ¯p1 = p¯2—otherwise, the pressure difference would give rise to bulk motion of the gas from
            one side of the container to the other, until the pressures were equalized. But, if the dimensions of
            the hole are less than the mean-free-path then we are dealing with effusion through the hole, rather
            than hydrodynamical flow. In this case, the equilibrium condition requires that the mass of gas
            on each side remain constant. In other words, the effusion rates in both directions must be equal.
            Thus, it follows from Equation (7.241) that
            p¯1
            √
            T1
            = p¯2
            √
            T2
            . (7.243)
            Thus, the pressures are not equal. Instead, a higher pressure prevails in the part of the container
            held at a higher temperature.
            162 7.17. Ferromagnetism
            7.17 Ferromagnetism
            Consider a solid substance consisting of N identical atoms arranged in a regular lattice. Each atom
            has a net electronic angular momentum,  S, and an associated magnetic moment, µ. [Here, we
            use S, rather than J, to denote atomic angular momentum (divided by ) to avoid confusion with
            the exchange energy, J, introduced in Equation (7.246).] The atomic magnetic moment is related
            to the corresponding total angular momentum via
            µ = g µB S, (7.244)
            where µB is the Bohr magneton, and the g-factor, g, is a dimensionless number of order unity. (See
            Section 7.9.) In the presence of an externally-applied magnetic field, B0 = Bz ez, directed parallel
            to the z-axis, the Hamiltonian, H0, representing the interaction of the atoms with this field is written
            H0 = −g µB
            
            j=1,N
            Sj · B0 = −g µB Bz
            
            j=1,N
            S j z. (7.245)
            Each atom is also assumed to interact with neighboring atoms. The interaction in question is
            not simply the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction due to the magnetic field produced by one atom
            at the position of another. Such an interaction is, in general, much too small to produce ferromagnetism. Instead, the predominant interaction is known as the exchange interaction. This interaction
            is a quantum-mechanical consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle. (See Section 8.2.) Because
            electrons cannot occupy the same state, two electrons on neighboring atoms that have parallel
            spins (here, to simplify the discussion of the origin of the exchange interaction, we are temporarily assuming that the electrons all have zero orbital angular momenta, so that their total angular
            momenta are solely a consequence of their spin angular momenta) cannot come too close to one
            another in space (else they would simultaneously occupy identical spin and orbital states, which is
            forbidden). On the other hand, if the electrons have antiparallel spins then they are in different spin
            states, so they are allowed to occupy the same orbital state. In other words, there is no exclusionrelated restriction on how close they can come together. Because different spatial separations of the
            electrons give rise to different electrostatic interaction between them, the electrostatic interaction
            between neighboring atoms (which is much stronger than any magnetic interaction) depends on
            the relative orientations of their spins. This, then, is the origin of the exchange interaction, which
            for two atoms labelled j and k can be written in the form
            Hjk = −2 J Sj · Sk. (7.246)
            Here, the so-called exchange energy, J, is a parameter (with the dimensions of energy) that depends
            on the atomic separation, and which measures the strength of the exchange interaction. If J > 0
            then the interaction energy is lower when spins on neighboring atoms are parallel, rather than antiparallel. This state of affairs favors parallel spin alignment of neighboring atoms. In other words,
            it tends to produce ferromagnetism. Note that, because the exchange interaction depends on the
            degree to which the electron orbitals of the two atoms can overlap, so as to occupy approximately
            the same region of space, the exchange energy, J, falls off very rapidly with increasing atomic
            separation. Hence, a given atom only interacts appreciably with its n (say) nearest neighbors.
            Applications of Statistical Thermodynamics 163
            To simplify the interaction problem, we shall replace the previous expression by the simpler
            functional form
            Hjk = −2 J S j z S k z. (7.247)
            This approximate expression, which is known as the Ising model, leaves the essential physical
            situation intact, while avoiding the complications introduced by vector quantities. The Ising model
            is equivalent to assuming that all atomic magnetic moments are either directed parallel or antiparallel to the z-axis.
            The Hamiltonian, H
            , representing the interaction energy between atoms is written in the form
            H = 1

            where J is the exchange energy for neighboring atoms, and the index k refers to the nearest neighbor shell surrounding the atom j. The factor 1/2 is introduced because the interaction between the
            same two atoms is counted twice in performing the sums.
            The total Hamiltonian of the atoms is
            H = H0 + H
            . (7.249)
            The task in hand is to calculate the mean magnetic moment of the system parallel to the applied
            magnetic field, Mz, as a function of its absolute temperature, T, and the applied field, Bz. The
            presence of the interatomic interactions makes this task difficult, despite the extreme simplicity of
            expression (7.248). Although the problem has been solved exactly for a linear one-dimensional array of atoms, and for two-dimensional array of atoms when Bz = 0, the three-dimensional problem
            is so complex that no exact solution has ever been found. Thus, in order to make further progress,
            we must introduce an additional approximation.
            Let us focus attention on a particular atom, j, which we shall refer to as the “central atom.”
            The interactions of this atom are described by the Hamiltonian
            Hj = −g µB Bz S j z − 2 J S j z 
            k=1,n
            S k z. (7.250)
            The final term represents the interaction of the central atom with its nearest neighbors. As a
            simplifying approximation, we shall replace the sum over these neighbors by its mean value. In
            other words, we shall write
            2 J
            
            k=1,n
            S k z  2 J
            
            k=1,n
            S k z = g µB Bm, (7.251)
            where Bm is a parameter with the dimensions of magnetic field-strength, which is called the molecular field, and is to be determined in such a way that it leads to a self-consistent solution of the
            statistical problem. In terms of this parameter, expression (7.250) becomes
            Hj = −g µB (Bz + Bm) S j z. (7.252)
            164 7.17. Ferromagnetism
            Thus, the influence of neighboring atoms has been replaced by an effective magnetic field, Bm.
            The problem presented by expression (7.252) reduces to the elementary one of a single atom, of
            normalized angular momentum, S , and g-factor, g, placed in an external z-directed magnetic field,
            Bz + Bm. Recall, however, that we already solved this problem in Section 7.9.
            According to the analysis of Section 7.9,
            S j z = S BS (η), (7.253)
            where
            η = βgµB (Bz + Bm), (7.254)
            and β = 1/(k T). Here, BS (η) is the Brillouin function, for normalized atomic angular momentum
            S , that was introduced in Equation (7.113).
            Expression (7.253) involves the unknown parameter Bm. To determine the value of this parameter in a self-consistent manner, we note that there is nothing that distinguishes the central
            jth atom from any of its neighboring atoms. Hence, any one of these atoms might equally well
            have been considered the central atom. Thus, the corresponding mean value S z is also given by
            Equation (7.253). It follows from Equations (7.251) and (7.253) that
            2 JnS BS (η) = g µB Bm. (7.255)
            The previous two equations can be combined to give
            BS (η) = k T
            2 JnS 
            
            η − g µB Bz
            k T 
            , (7.256)
            which determines η (and, hence, Bm). Once η has been found, the mean magnetic moment of the
            system follows from Equation (7.253):
            Mz = g µB
            
            j
            S j z = N g µB S BS (η). (7.257)
            The solution of Equation (7.256) can be found by drawing, on the same graph, both the Brillouin function y = BS (η) and the straight-line
            y = k T
            2 JnS

            k T 
            , (7.258)
            and then finding the point of intersection of the two curves. See Figure 7.9.
            Consider the case where the external field, Bz, is zero. Equation (7.256) simplifies to give
            BS (η) =
             k T
            2 JnS 
            η. (7.259)
            Given that BS (0) = 0, it follows that η = 0 is a solution of the previous equation. This solution
            is characterized by zero magnetization: that is, Mz = 0. However, there is also the possibility of
            another solution with η  0, and, hence, Mz  0. (See Figure 7.9.) The presence of such spontaneous magnetization in the absence of an external magnetic field is, of course, the distinguishing

            condition for the existence of an intersection with η  0 is that the slope of the curve y = BJ (η) at

            where
            k Tc = 2 JnS (S + 1)
            3 . (7.264)
            Thus, we deduce that spontaneous magnetization of a ferromagnetic material is only possible below
            a certain critical temperature, Tc, known as the Curie temperature. The magnetized state, in which
            all atomic magnetic moments can exploit their mutual exchange energy by being preferentially
            aligned parallel to one another, has a lower magnetic energy than the unmagnetized state in which
            η = 0. Thus, at temperatures below the Curie temperature, the magnetized state is stable, whereas
            the unmagnetized state is unstable.
            As the temperature, T, is decreased below the Curie temperature, Tc, the slope of the dashdotted straight-line in Figure 7.9 decreases so that it intersects the curve y = BS (η) at increasingly
            large values of η. As T → 0, the intersection occurs at η → ∞. Because, BS (∞) = 1 [see Equation (7.117)], it follows from Equation (7.257) that Mz → N g µB S as T → 0. This corresponds to
            a state in which all atomic magnetic moments are aligned completely parallel to one another. For
            temperatures, T, less than the Curie temperature, Tc, we can use Equations (7.257) and (7.259) to
            compute Mz(T) in the absence of an external magnetic field. We then obtain a magnetization curve
            of the general form shown in Figure 7.10.
            Let us, finally, investigate the magnetic susceptibility of a ferromagnetic substance, in the presence of a small external magnetic field, at temperatures above the Curie temperature. In this case,
            the crossing point of the two curves in Figure 7.9 lies at small η. Hence, we can use the approxi-

            mation (7.261) to write Equation (7.256) in the form

            , (7.266)
            where use has been made of Equation (7.264). Now, making use of the approximation (7.261),
            Equation (7.257) reduces to

            3

            where χ is the dimensionless magnetic susceptibility of the substance, and V is its volume. This
            result is known as the Curie-Weiss law. It differs from Curie’s law, χ ∝ 1/T (see Section 7.3),
            because of the presence of the parameter Tc in the denominator. According to the Curie-Weiss law,
            χ becomes infinite when T → Tc: that is, at the Curie temperature, when the substance becomes
            ferromagnetic.
            Experimentally, the Curie-Weiss law is well obeyed at temperatures significantly above the
            Curie temperature. See Figure 7.11. It is, however, not true that the temperature, Tc, that occurs
            in this law is exactly the same as the Curie temperature at which the substance becomes ferromagnetic.
            The so-called Weiss molecular-field model (which was first put forward by Pierre Weiss in
            1907) that we have just described is remarkably successful at explaining the major features of
            ferromagnetism. Nevertheless, there are some serious discrepancies between the predictions of this
            simple model and experimental data. In particular, the magnetic contribution to the specific heat is
            observed to have a very sharp discontinuity at the Curie temperature (in the absence of an external
            field), whereas the molecular field model predicts a much less abrupt change. Needless to say, more
            refined models have been devised that considerably improve the agreement with experimental data.

            7.3 A sample of mineral oil is placed in an external magnetic field B. Each proton has spin
            1/2, and a magnetic moment µ. It can, therefore, have two possible energies,  = ∓ µ B,
            corresponding to the two possible orientations of its spin. An applied radio-frequency field
            can induce transitions between these two energy levels if its frequency ν satisfies the Bohr
            condition h ν = 2 µ B. The power absorbed from this radiation field is then proportional to
            the difference in the number of nuclei in these two energy levels. Assume that the protons
            in the mineral oil are in thermal equilibrium at a temperature T that is sufficiently high that
            µ B  k T. How does the absorbed power depend on the temperature, T, of the sample?
            7.4 Consider an assembly of N0 weakly-interacting magnetic atoms per unit volume, held at
            temperature T. According to classical physics, each atomic magnetic moment, µ, can be
            orientated so as to make an arbitrary angle θ with respect to the z-direction (say). In the
            absence of an external magnetic field, the probability that the angle lies between θ and
            θ + dθ is simply proportional to the solid angle, 2π sin θ dθ, enclosed in this range. In the
            presence of a magnetic field of strength Bz, directed parallel to the z-axis, this probability is
            further proportional to the Boltzmann factor, exp(−β E), where β = 1/(k T), and E = −µ·B
            is the magnetic energy of the atom.
            (a) Show that the classical mean magnetization is

            7.6 The nuclei of atoms in a certain crystalline solid have spin one. According to quantum
            theory, each nucleus can therefore be in any one of three quantum states labeled by the
            quantum number m, where m = 1, 0, or −1. This quantum number measures the projection
            of the nuclear spin along a crystal axis of the solid. Because the electric charge distribution
            in the nucleus is not spherically symmetric, but ellipsoidal, the energy of a nucleus depends
            on its spin orientation with respect to the internal electric field existing at its location. Thus
            a nucleus has the same energy E =  in the state m = 1 and the state m = −1, compared
            with energy E = 0 in the state m = 0.
            (a) Find an expression, as a function of absolute temperature, T, of the nuclear contribution to the molar internal energy of the solid.

            at high temperatures. Show that the expression in part (b) reduces properly to these
            values as T → 0 and T → ∞.
            (d) Make a qualitative graph showing the temperature dependence of the nuclear contribution to the molar heat capacity of the solid. Calculate the temperature dependence
            explicitly. What is the temperature dependence for large values of T?

            ω = cs k, where cs is the velocity of sound. On the other hand, in a ferromagnetic solid at
            low temperatures, quantized waves of magnetization (spin waves) have their frequencies,
            ω, related to their wavevectors, k, according to the dispersion relation ω = A k 2, where A

            then be pumped off to some collecting chamber. The vessel is filled with dilute gas containing two types of molecule which differ because they contain different atomic isotopes, and
            thus have the different masses, m1 and m2. The concentrations of these molecules are c1 and
            c2, respectively, and are maintained constant within the vessel by constantly replenishing

            8 Quantum Statistics
            8.1 Introduction
            Previously, we investigated the statistical thermodynamics of ideal gases using a rather ad hoc combination of classical and quantum mechanics. (See, for example, Sections 7.7 and 7.8.) In fact,
            we employed classical mechanics to deal with the translational degrees of freedom of the constituent particles, and quantum mechanics to deal with the non-translational degrees of freedom.
            Let us now discuss ideal gases from a purely quantum-mechanical standpoint. It turns out that
            this approach is necessary in order to treat either very low-temperature or very high-density gases.
            Furthermore, it also allows us to investigate completely non-classical “gases,” such as photons, or
            the conduction electrons in a metal.
            8.2 Symmetry Requirements in Quantum Mechanics
            Consider a gas consisting of N identical, non-interacting, structureless particles, enclosed within
            a container of volume V. Let Qi denote collectively all the coordinates of the ith particle. In
            other words, the three Cartesian coordinates that determine its spatial position, as well as the spin
            coordinate that determines its internal state. Let si be an index labeling the possible quantum states
            of the ith particle. It follows that each possible value of si corresponds to a specification of the three
            momentum components of the particle, as well as the direction of its spin orientation. According
            to quantum mechanics, the overall state of the system when the ith particle is in state si, et cetera,
            is completely determined by the complex wavefunction
            Ψs1,··· ,sN (Q1, Q2, ··· , QN). (8.1)
            In particular, the probability of an observation of the system finding the ith particle with coordinates
            in the range Qi to Qi + dQi, et cetera, is simply
            |Ψs1,··· ,sN (Q1, Q2, ··· , QN)|
            2 dQ1 dQ2 ··· dQN. (8.2)
            One of the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics is the essential indistinguishability
            of particles of the same species. What this means, in practice, is that we cannot label particles of
            the same species. In other words, a proton is just a proton—we cannot meaningfully talk of proton
            number 1, or proton number 2, et cetera. Note that no such constraint arises in classical mechanics.
            Thus, in classical mechanics, particles of the same species are regarded as being distinguishable,
            and can, therefore, be labelled. Of course, the quantum-mechanical approach is the correct one.
            Suppose that we interchange the ith and jth particles: that is,
            Qi ↔ Qj, (8.3)
            si ↔ sj. (8.4)
            178 8.2. Symmetry Requirements in Quantum Mechanics
            If the particles are truly indistinguishable then nothing has changed. We have a particle in quantum
            state si and a particle in quantum state sj both before and after the particles are swapped. Thus, the
            probability of observing the system in a given state also cannot have changed: that is,
            |Ψ(··· Qi ··· Qj ···)|
            2 = |Ψ(··· Qj ··· Qi ···)|
            2
            . (8.5)
            Here, we have omitted the subscripts s1, ··· , sN for the sake of clarity. Equation (8.5) implies that
            Ψ(··· Qi ··· Qj ···) = A Ψ(··· Qj ··· Qi ···), (8.6)
            where A is a complex constant of modulus unity: that is, |A|
            2 = 1.
            Suppose that we interchange the ith and jth particles a second time. Swapping the ith and
            jth particles twice leaves the system completely unchanged. In other words, it is equivalent to
            doing nothing at all to the system. Thus, the wavefunctions before and after this process must be
            identical. It follows from Equation (8.6) that
            A2 = 1. (8.7)
            Of course, the only solutions to the previous equation are A = ±1.
            We conclude, from the previous discussion, that the wavefunction, Ψ, is either completely
            symmetric under the interchange of identical particles, or it is completely anti-symmetric. In other
            words, either
            Ψ(··· Qi ··· Qj ···) = +Ψ(··· Qj ··· Qi ···), (8.8)
            or
            Ψ(··· Qi ··· Qj ···) = −Ψ(··· Qj ··· Qi ···). (8.9)
            In 1940, the Nobel prize-winning physicist Wolfgang Pauli demonstrated, via arguments involving relativistic invariance, that the wavefunction associated with a collection of identical integerspin (i.e., spin 0, 1, 2, etc.) particles satisfies Equation (8.8), whereas the wavefunction associated
            with a collection of identical half-integer-spin (i.e., spin 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, etc.) particles satisfies Equation (8.9). The former type of particles are known as bosons [after the Indian physicist S.N. Bose,
            who first put forward Equation (8.8) on empirical grounds]. The latter type of particles are called
            fermions(after the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, who first studied the properties of fermion gases).
            Common examples of bosons are photons and He4 atoms. Common examples of fermions are protons, neutrons, and electrons.
            Consider a gas made up of identical bosons. Equation (8.8) implies that the interchange of any
            two particles does not lead to a new state of the system. Bosons must, therefore, be considered as
            genuinely indistinguishable when enumerating the different possible states of the gas. Note that
            Equation (8.8) imposes no restriction on how many particles can occupy a given single-particle
            quantum state, s.
            Consider a gas made up of identical fermions. Equation (8.9) implies that the interchange of
            any two particles does not lead to a new physical state of the system (because |Ψ|
            2 is invariant).
            Hence, fermions must also be considered genuinely indistinguishable when enumerating the different possible states of the gas. Consider the special case where particles i and j lie in the same
            Quantum Statistics 179
            quantum state. In this case, the act of swapping the two particles is equivalent to leaving the system
            unchanged, so
            Ψ(··· Qi ··· Qj ···) = Ψ(··· Qj ··· Qi ···). (8.10)
            However, Equation (8.9) is also applicable, because the two particles are fermions. The only way
            in which Equations (8.9) and (8.10) can be reconciled is if
            Ψ = 0 (8.11)
            wherever particles i and j lie in the same quantum state. This is another way of saying that it is
            impossible for any two particles in a gas of identical fermions to lie in the same single-particle
            quantum state. This proposition is known as the Pauli exclusion principle, because it was first
            proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1924 on empirical grounds.
            Consider, for the sake of comparison, a gas made up of identical classical particles. In this case,
            the particles must be considered distinguishable when enumerating the different possible states of
            the gas. Furthermore, there are no constraints on how many particles can occupy a given quantum
            state.
            According to the previous discussion, there are three different sets of rules that can be used
            to enumerate the states of a gas made up of identical particles. For a boson gas, the particles
            must be treated as being indistinguishable, and there is no limit to how many particles can occupy
            a given quantum state. This set of rules is called Bose-Einstein statistics, after S.N. Bose and
            A. Einstein, who first developed them. For a fermion gas, the particles must be treated as being
            indistinguishable, and there can never be more than one particle in any given quantum state. This
            set of rules is called Fermi-Dirac statistics, after E. Fermi and P.A.M. Dirac, who first developed
            them. Finally, for a classical gas, the particles must be treated as being distinguishable, and there
            is no limit to how many particles can occupy a given quantum state. This set of rules is called
            Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, after J.C. Maxwell and L. Boltzmann, who first developed them.
            8.3 Illustrative Example
            Consider a very simple gas made up of two identical particles. Suppose that each particle can be in
            one of three possible quantum states, s = 1, 2, 3. Let us enumerate the possible states of the whole
            gas according to Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, and Fermi-Dirac statistics, respectively.
            For the case of Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, the two particles are considered to be distinguishable. Let us denote them A and B. Furthermore, any number of particles can occupy the same
            quantum state. The possible different states of the gas are shown in Table 8.1. There are clearly
            nine distinct states.
            For the case of Bose-Einstein statistics, the two particles are considered to be indistinguishable.
            Let us denote them both as A. Furthermore, any number of particles can occupy the same quantum
            state. The possible different states of the gas are shown in Table 8.2. There are clearly six distinct
            states.
            Finally, for the case of Fermi-Dirac statistics, the two particles are considered to be indistinguishable. Let us again denote them both as A. Furthermore, no more than one particle can occupy

            It follows, from the previous example, that Fermi-Dirac (FD) statistics are more restrictive (i.e.,
            there are less possible states of the system) than Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics, which are, in turn,
            more restrictive than Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) statistics. Let
            ξ = probability that the two particles are found in the same state
            probability that the two particles are found in different states. (8.12)
            Quantum Statistics 181
            For the case under investigation,
            ξMB = 1/2, (8.13)
            ξBE = 1, (8.14)
            ξFD = 0. (8.15)
            We conclude that in Bose-Einstein statistics there is a greater relative tendency for particles to
            cluster in the same state than in classical (i.e., Maxwell-Boltzmann) statistics. On the other hand,
            in Fermi-Dirac statistics there is a lesser tendency for particles to cluster in the same state than in
            classical statistics.
            8.4 Formulation of Statistical Problem
            Consider a gas consisting of N identical non-interacting particles occupying volume V, and in
            thermal equilibrium at absolute temperature T. Let us label the possible quantum states of a single
            particle by r (or s). Let the energy of a particle in state r be denoted r. Let the number of particles
            in state r be written nr. Finally, let us label the possible quantum states of the whole gas by R.
            The particles are assumed to be non-interacting, so the total energy of the gas in state R, where
            there are nr particles in quantum state r, et cetera, is simply
            ER =
            
            r
            nr r, (8.16)
            where the sum extends over all possible quantum states, r. Furthermore, because the total number
            of particles in the gas is known to be N, we must have
            N =
            
            r
            nr. (8.17)
            In order to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the gas (i.e., its internal energy or its
            entropy), it is necessary to calculate its partition function,
            Z =
            
            R
            e−β ER =
            
            R
            e−β (n1 1+n2 2+···)
            . (8.18)
            Here, the sum is over all possible states, R, of the whole gas. That is, over all the various possible
            values of the numbers n1, n2, ··· .
            Now, exp[−β (n1 1 + n2 2 + ···)] is the relative probability of finding the gas in a particular
            state in which there are n1 particles in state 1, n2 particles in state 2, et cetera. Thus, the mean
            number of particles in quantum state s can be written
            n¯s =
            
            R ns exp[−β (n1 1 + n2 2 + ···)]
            
            R exp[−β (n1 1 + n2 2 + ···)] . (8.19)
            A comparison of Equations (8.18) and (8.19) yields the result
            n¯s = −1
            β
            ∂ ln Z
            ∂s
            . (8.20)
            Here, β ≡ 1/(k T).
            182 8.5. Fermi-Dirac Statistics
            8.5 Fermi-Dirac Statistics
            Let us, first of all, consider Fermi-Dirac statistics. According to Equation (8.19), the average
            number of particles in quantum state s can be written
            n¯s =
            
            ns ns e−β ns s (s)
            n1,n2,··· e−β (n1 1+n2 2+···)
            
            ns e−β ns s (s)
            n1,n2,··· e−β (n1 1+n2 2+···) . (8.21)
            Here, we have rearranged the order of summation, using the multiplicative properties of the exponential function. Note that the first sums in the numerator and denominator only involve ns,
            whereas the last sums omit the particular state s from consideration (this is indicated by the superscript s on the summation symbol). Of course, the sums in the previous expression range over all
            values of the numbers n1, n2, ··· such that nr = 0 and 1 for each r, subject to the overall constraint
            that
            
            r
            nr = N. (8.22)
            Let us introduce the function
            Zs(N) =
            
            (s)
            n1,n2,···
            e−β (n1 1+n2 2+··· )
            , (8.23)
            which is defined as the partition function for N particles distributed over all quantum states, excluding state s, according to Fermi-Dirac statistics. By explicitly performing the sum over ns = 0
            and 1, the expression (8.21) reduces to
            n¯s = 0 + e−β s Zs(N − 1)
            Zs(N) + e−β s Zs(N − 1), (8.24)
            which yields
            n¯s = 1
            [Zs(N)/Zs(N − 1)] e β s + 1
            . (8.25)
            In order to make further progress, we must somehow relate Zs(N − 1) to Zs(N). Suppose that
            ∆N  N. It follows that ln Zs(N − ∆N) can be Taylor expanded to give
            ln Zs(N − ∆N)  ln Zs(N) − ∂ ln Zs
            ∂N
            ∆N = ln Zs(N) − αs ∆N, (8.26)
            where
            αs ≡
            ∂ ln Zs
            ∂N . (8.27)
            As always, we Taylor expand the slowly-varying function ln Zs(N), rather than the rapidly-varying
            function Zs(N), because the radius of convergence of the latter Taylor series is too small for the
            series to be of any practical use. Equation (8.26) can be rearranged to give
            Zs(N − ∆N) = Zs(N) e−αs ∆N. (8.28)
            Quantum Statistics 183
            Now, because Zs(N) is a sum over very many different quantum states, we would not expect
            the logarithm of this function to be sensitive to which particular state, s, is excluded from consideration. Let us, therefore, introduce the approximation that αs is independent of s, so that we can
            write
            αs  α (8.29)
            for all s. It follows that the derivative (8.27) can be expressed approximately in terms of the
            derivative of the full partition function Z(N) (in which the N particles are distributed over all
            quantum states). In fact,
            α  ∂ ln Z
            ∂N . (8.30)
            Making use of Equation (8.28), with ∆N = 1, plus the approximation (8.29), the expression
            (8.25) reduces to
            n¯s = 1
            e α+β s + 1
            . (8.31)
            This is called the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The parameter α is determined by the constraint that
            
            r n¯r = N: that is,
            
            r
            1
            e α+β r + 1 = N. (8.32)
            Note that ¯ns → 0 if s becomes sufficiently large. On the other hand, because the denominator
            in Equation (8.31) can never become less than unity, no matter how small s becomes, it follows
            that ¯ns ≤ 1. Thus,
            0 ≤ n¯s ≤ 1, (8.33)
            in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle.
            Equations (8.20) and (8.30) can be integrated to give
            ln Z = α N +
            

            , (8.34)
            where use has been made of Equation (8.31).
            8.6 Photon Statistics
            Up to now, we have assumed that the number of particles, N, contained in a given system is a
            fixed number. This is a reasonable assumption if the particles possess non-zero mass, because
            we are not generally considering relativistic systems in this course (i.e., we are assuming that the
            particle energies are much less than their rest-mass energies). However, this assumption breaks
            down for the case of photons, which are zero-mass bosons. In fact, photons enclosed in a container
            of volume V, maintained at temperature T, can readily be absorbed or emitted by the walls. Thus,
            for the special case of a gas of photons, there is no requirement that limits the total number of
            particles.
            184 8.7. Bose-Einstein Statistics
            It follows, from the previous discussion, that photons obey a simplified form of Bose-Einstein
            statistics in which there is an unspecified total number of particles. This type of statistics is called
            photon statistics.
            Consider the expression (8.21). For the case of photons, the numbers n1, n2, ··· assume all
            values nr = 0, 1, 2, ··· for each r, without any further restriction. It follows that the sums (s)
            in the numerator and denominator are identical and, therefore, cancel. Hence, Equation (8.21)
            reduces to
            n¯s =
            
            ns ns e−β ns s
            
            ns e−β ns s . (8.35)
            However, the previous expression can be rewritten
            n¯s = −1
            β
            ∂
            ∂s

            ns
            e−β ns s
            
             . (8.36)
            Now, the sum on the right-hand side of the previous equation is an infinite geometric series, which
            can easily be evaluated. In fact,
            
            ns=0,∞
            e−β ns s = 1 + e−β s + e−2 β s + ··· = 1
            1 − e−β s
            . (8.37)
            (See Exercise 7.1.) Thus, Equation (8.36) gives
            n¯s = 1
            β
            ∂
            ∂s
            ln (1 − e−β s
            ) = e−β s
            1 − e−β s
            , (8.38)
            or
            n¯s = 1
            e β s − 1
            . (8.39)
            This is known as the Planck distribution, after the German physicist Max Planck who first proposed
            it in 1900 on purely empirical grounds.
            Equation (8.20) can be integrated to give
            ln Z = −
            
            r
            ln 
            1 − e−β r
            
            , (8.40)
            where use has been made of Equation (8.39).
            8.7 Bose-Einstein Statistics
            Let us now consider Bose-Einstein statistics. The particles in the system are assumed to be massive,
            so the total number of particles, N, is a fixed number.
            Consider the expression (8.21). For the case of massive bosons, the numbers n1, n2, ··· assume
            all values nr = 0, 1, 2, ··· for each r, subject to the constraint that 
            r nr = N. Performing explicitly
            the sum over ns, this expression reduces to
            n¯s = 0 + e−β s Zs(N − 1) + 2 e−2 β s Zs(N − 2) + ···
            Zs(N) + e−β s Zs(N − 1) + e−2 β s Zs(N − 2) + ···, (8.41)
            Quantum Statistics 185
            where Zs(N) is the partition function for N particles distributed over all quantum states, excluding
            state s, according to Bose-Einstein statistics [cf., Equation (8.23)]. Using Equation (8.28), and the
            approximation (8.29), the previous equation reduces to
            n¯s =
            
            s ns e−ns (α+β s)
            
            s e−ns (α+β s) . (8.42)
            Note that this expression is identical to (8.35), except that β s is replaced by α + β s. Hence, an
            analogous calculation to that outlined in the previous section yields
            n¯s = 1
            e α+β s − 1
            . (8.43)
            This is called the Bose-Einstein distribution. Note that ¯ns can become very large in this distribution.
            The parameter α is again determined by the constraint on the total number of particles: that is,
            
            r
            1
            e α+β r − 1 = N. (8.44)
            Equations (8.20) and (8.30) can be integrated to give
            ln Z = α N −
            
            r
            ln 
            1 − e−α−β r
            
            , (8.45)
            where use has been made of Equation (8.43).
            Note that photon statistics correspond to the special case of Bose-Einstein statistics in which
            the parameter α takes the value zero, and the constraint (8.44) does not apply.
            8.8 Maxwell-Boltzmann Statistics
            For the purpose of comparison, it is instructive to consider the purely classical case of MaxwellBoltzmann statistics. The partition function is written
            Z =
            
            R
            e−β (n1 1+n2 2+···)
            , (8.46)
            where the sum is over all distinct states R of the gas, and the particles are treated as distinguishable.
            For given values of n1, n2, ··· there are
            N!
            n1! n2! ··· (8.47)
            possible ways in which N distinguishable particles can be put into individual quantum states such
            that there are n1 particles in state 1, n2 particles in state 2, et cetera. Each of these possible arrangements corresponds to a distinct state for the whole gas. Hence, Equation (8.46) can be written
            Z =
            
            n1,n2,···
            N!
            n1! n2! ··· e−β (n1 1+n2 2+···)
            , (8.48)
            186 8.9. Quantum Statistics in Classical Limit
            where the sum is over all values of nr = 0, 1, 2, ··· for each r, subject to the constraint that
            
            r
            nr = N. (8.49)
            Now, Equation (8.48) can be written
            Z =
            
            n1,n2,···
            N!
            n1! n2! ··· (e−β 1 )
            n1 (e−β 2 )
            n2 ··· , (8.50)
            which, by virtue of Equation (8.49), is just the result of expanding a polynomial. In fact,
            Z = (e−β 1 + e−β 2 + ···)
            N, (8.51)
            or
            ln Z = N ln
            
            

            r
            e−β r
            
             . (8.52)
            Note that the argument of the logarithm is simply the single-particle partition function
            Equations (8.20) and (8.52) can be combined to give
            n¯s = N
            e−β s
            
            r e−β r
            . (8.53)
            This is known as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. It is, of course, just the result obtained by
            applying the canonical distribution to a single particle. (See Chapter 7.) The previous expression
            can also be written in the form
            n¯s = e−α−β r
            , (8.54)
            where
            
            r
            e−α−β r = N. (8.55)
            The Bose-Einstein, Maxwell-Boltzmann, and Fermi-Dirac distributions are illustrated in Figure 8.1.
            8.9 Quantum Statistics in Classical Limit
            The preceding analysis regarding the quantum statistics of ideal gases is summarized in the following statements. The mean number of particles occupying quantum state s is given by
            n¯s = 1
            e α+β s ± 1
            , (8.56)
            where the upper sign corresponds to Fermi-Dirac statistics and the lower sign corresponds to BoseEinstein statistics. The parameter α is determined via

            and Fermi-Dirac (dash-dotted curve) distributions.
            Finally, the partition function of the gas is given by
            ln Z = α N ±
            
            r
            ln 
            1 ± e−α−β r
            
            . (8.58)
            Let us investigate the magnitude of α in some important limiting cases. Consider, first of all,
            the case of a gas at a given temperature when its concentration is made sufficiently low: that is,
            when N is made sufficiently small. The relation (8.57) can only be satisfied if each term in the
            sum over states is made sufficiently small; that is, if ¯nr  1 or α + β r 
             1 for all states r. (See
            Figure 8.1.)
            Consider, next, the case of a gas made up of a fixed number of particles when its temperature is
            made sufficiently large. That is, when β is made sufficiently small. In the sum in Equation (8.57),
            the terms of appreciable magnitude are those for which α + β r < 1. (See Figure 8.1.) Thus, it
            follows that as β → 0 an increasing number of terms with large values of r contribute substantially
            to this sum. In order to prevent the sum from exceeding N, the parameter α must become large
            enough that each term is made sufficiently small: that is, it is again necessary that ¯nr  1 or
            α + β r 
             1 for all states r.
            The previous discussion suggests that if the concentration of an ideal gas is made sufficiently
            low, or the temperature is made sufficiently high, then α must become so large that
            exp(α + β r) 
             1 (8.59)
            for all r. Equivalently, this means that the number of particles occupying each quantum state must
            become so small that
            n¯r  1 (8.60)
            188 8.9. Quantum Statistics in Classical Limit
            for all r. It is conventional to refer to the limit of sufficiently low concentration, or sufficiently high
            temperature, in which Equations (8.59) and Equations (8.60) are satisfied, as the classical limit.
            According to Equations (8.56) and (8.59), both the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions
            reduce to
            n¯s = exp(−α − β s) (8.61)
            in the classical limit, whereas the constraint (8.57) yields
            
            r
            exp(−α − β r) = N. (8.62)
            The previous expressions can be combined to give
            n¯s = N
            e−β s
            
            r e−β r
            . (8.63)
            It follows that in the classical limit of sufficiently low density, or sufficiently high temperature,
            the quantum distribution functions, whether Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein, reduce to the MaxwellBoltzmann distribution. It is easily demonstrated that the physical criterion for the validity of the
            classical approximation is that the mean separation between particles should be much greater than
            their mean de Broglie wavelengths. (See Exercise 8.21.)
            Let us now consider the behavior of the partition function (8.58) in the classical limit. We can
            expand the logarithm to give
            ln Z = α N ±
            

            = α N + N. (8.64)
            However, according to Equation (8.62),
            α = − ln N + ln

            
             . (8.65)
            It follows that
            ln Z = −N ln N + N + N ln

            

            e−β r
            
             . (8.66)
            Note that this expression does not match the partition function ZMB computed in Equation (8.52)
            from Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, which gives
            ln ZMB = N ln
            
            

            In fact,
            ln Z  ln ZMB − ln N!, (8.68)
            or
            Z = ZMB
            N! , (8.69)
            Quantum Statistics 189
            where use has been made of Stirling’s approximation (N!  N ln N − N), because N is large.
            Here, the factor N! simply corresponds to the number of different permutations of the N particles:
            permutations that are physically meaningless when the particles are identical. Recall, that we had
            to introduce precisely this factor, in an ad hoc fashion, in Section 7.8, in order to avoid the nonphysical consequences of the Gibb’s paradox. Clearly, there is no Gibb’s paradox when an ideal
            gas is treated properly via quantum mechanics.
            A gas in the classical limit, where the typical de Broglie wavelength of the constituent particles
            is much smaller than the typical inter-particle spacing, is said to be non-degenerate. In the opposite
            limit, where the concentration and temperature are such that the typical de Broglie wavelength
            becomes comparable with the typical inter-particle spacing, and the actual Fermi-Dirac or BoseEinstein distributions must be employed, the gas is said to be degenerate.
            8.10 Quantum-Mechanical Treatment of Ideal Gas
            Let us calculate the partition function of an ideal gas from quantum mechanics, making use of
            Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. Obviously, such a partition function is only applicable when the gas
            is non-degenerate. According to Equations (8.67) and (8.69), we can write the partition function
            in the form
            Z = ζ N
            N!
            , (8.70)
            where N is the number of constituent molecules,
            ζ =
            
            r
            e−β r (8.71)
            is the partition function of an individual molecule, and the factor N! is necessary to take into
            account the fact that the molecules are indistinguishable according to quantum theory.
            Suppose that the gas is enclosed in a parallelepiped with sides of lengths Lx, Ly, and Lz. It
            follows that the de Broglie wavenumbers of the constituent molecules are quantized such that
            kx = nx
            π
            Lx
            , (8.72)

            Now, in the previous equation, the successive terms in the sum over kx (say) correspond to a

            increasing Lx), and, therefore, differ very little from each other. Hence, it is an excellent approximation to replace the sums in Equation (8.77) by integrals. Given that 1 = ∆nx = (Lx/2π) dkx, we

            8.11 Derivation of van der Waals Equation of State
            We shall now extend the analysis of the previous section to derive an approximate equation of state
            for a non-ideal gas. Let us focus attention on a single molecule. It seems reasonable to suppose
            that this molecule moves in an effective potential, Ue(r), due to all the other molecules in the gas
            (which are assumed to remain unaffected by the presence of the molecule under consideration).
            Under these circumstances, the partition function of the gas reduces to that of N independent
            particles, each with a kinetic energy p2/(2 m), and a potential energy Ue.
            Proceeding classically (except that the molecules are treated as indistinguishable, and the arbitrary parameter h0 is replaced by Planck’s constant), we obtain
            Z = 1

            The remaining integral extends over the volume, V, of the container. To make further progress,
            we note that there are regions in which Ue → ∞ because of the strong repulsion between molecules
            when they approach one another too closely. Thus, the integrand vanishes in these regions, which
            are assumed to have a total volume Vx < V. In the remaining volume, V −Vx, where Ue is assumed
            to vary relatively slowly with inter-molecular separation, we shall replace Ue by some effective
            constant average value, Ue. Thus, the previous equation becomes
            Z = 1

            It remains to estimate the values of the parameters Ue and Vx. The total mean potential energy
            of the molecules is N Ue. But, because there are (1/2) N (N − 1)  (1/2) N2 pairs of molecules in
            the gas, it follows that the total mean potential energy is also (1/2) N2 u¯, where u is the potential
            energy of interaction between a given pair of molecules. Equating the different expressions for the
            total mean potential energy of the gas, we obtain N Ue = (1/2) N2 u, or
            Ue = 1
            2 N u. (8.89)
            To estimate the mean potential energy, ¯u, between a pair of molecules, let us make the simplistic
            assumption that the interaction potential takes the form
            u(R) =
            # ∞ R < R0
            −u0 (R0/R)
            s R > R0

            where R is separation between the molecular centers, u0 > 0, and s > 0. Thus, the molecules
            act as weakly-attracting hard spheres of radius (1/2) R0. The choice of exponent s = 6 is usually
            the most appropriate. (See Exercise 8.8.) Concentrating attention on a particular molecule, and
            making the crudest possible approximation, we shall say that another molecule is equally likely to
            be anywhere in the container that is a distance R greater than R0 from the given molecule. Thus,
            the probability of the distance lying between R and R + dR is (4π R2 dR)/V, and

            R2 dR. (8.91)
            Let us assume that s > 3: in other words, the potential u(R) falls off sufficiently rapidly for the
            previous integral to converge properly. Thus, Equation (8.89) becomes
            Ue = 1

            N u = −a N

            By Equation (8.90), the distance of closest approach between molecules is R0. Thus, in each
            encounter between a pair of molecules, there is a volume excluded to one molecule, by virtue of the
            presence of the other molecule, that is equal to the volume of a sphere of radius R0. Because there
            are (1/2) N (N−1)  (1/2) N2 pairs of molecules, the total excluded volume is (1/2) N 2 (4/3) π R3
            0 .
            But, for the sake of consistency, this volume must be equal to N Vx, because Vx was understood to
            be the excluded volume per molecule. Thus, it follows that
            Vx = b N, (8.94)

            Of course, Equation (8.100) is identical to the well-known van der Waals equation of state. (See
            Section 6.15.) Our analysis allows us to relate the constants, a and b, appearing in this equation of
            state, to the inter-molecular potential.
            8.12 Planck Radiation Law
            Let us now consider the application of statistical thermodynamics to electromagnetic radiation.
            According to Maxwell’s theory, an electromagnetic wave is a coupled self-sustaining oscillation of
            electric and magnetic fields that propagates though a vacuum at the speed of light, c = 3×108 m s−1
            .
            The electric component of the wave can be written
            E = E0 exp[ i (k·r − ωt)], (8.103)
            where E0 is a constant, k is the wavevector that determines the wavelength and direction of propagation of the wave, and ω is the angular frequency. The dispersion relation
            ω = k c (8.104)
            ensures that the wave propagates at the speed of light. Note that this dispersion relation is very
            similar to that of sound waves in solids. [See Equation (7.177).] Electromagnetic waves always
            propagate in the direction perpendicular to the coupled electric and magnetic fields (i.e., electromagnetic waves are transverse waves). This means that k·E0 = 0. Thus, once k is specified, there
            are only two possible independent directions for the electric field. These correspond to the two
            independent polarizations of electromagnetic waves.
            Consider an enclosure whose walls are maintained at fixed temperature T. What is the nature
            of the steady-state electromagnetic radiation inside the enclosure? Suppose that the enclosure is a
            parallelepiped with sides of lengths Lx, Ly, and Lz. Alternatively (and more conveniently), suppose
            that the radiation field inside the enclosure is periodic in the x-, y-, and z-directions, with periodicity
            lengths Lx, Ly, and Lz, respectively. As long as the smallest of these lengths, L, say, is much greater
            than the longest wavelength of interest in the problem, λ = 2π/k, then these assumptions should
            not significantly affect the nature of the radiation inside the enclosure. We find, just as in our earlier
            194 8.12. Planck Radiation Law
            discussion of sound waves (see Section 7.14), that the periodicity constraints ensure that there are
            only a discrete set of allowed wavevectors (i.e., a discrete set of allowed modes of oscillation of the
            electromagnetic field inside the enclosure). Let ρ(k) d 3
            k be the number of allowed modes per unit
            volume with wavevectors in the range k to k + dk. We know, by analogy with Equation (7.183),
            that
            ρ(k) d 3
            k = d 3k
            (2π)3 . (8.105)
            The number of modes per unit volume for which the magnitude of the wavevector lies in the range
            k to k+dk is just the density of modes, ρ(k), multiplied by the “volume” in k-space of the spherical
            shell lying between radii k and k + dk. Thus,
            ρk(k) dk = 4π k 2 dk
            (2π)3 = k 2
            2π2 dk. (8.106)
            Finally, the number of modes per unit volume whose frequencies lie between ω and ω + dω is, by
            Equation (8.104),
            σ(ω) dω = 2 ρk(k) dk
            dω
            dω = 2 ω2
            2π2 c 3 dω. (8.107)
            Here, the additional factor 2 is to take account of the two independent polarizations of the electromagnetic field for a given wavevector, k.
            Let us consider the situation classically. By analogy with sound waves, we can treat each allowable mode of oscillation of the electromagnetic field as an independent harmonic oscillator.
            According to the equipartition theorem (see Section 7.10), each mode possesses a mean energy k T
            in thermal equilibrium at temperature T. In fact, (1/2) k T resides with the oscillating electric field,
            and another (1/2) k T with the oscillating magnetic field. Thus, the classical energy density of electromagnetic radiation (i.e., the energy per unit volume associated with modes whose frequencies
            lie in the range ω to ω + dω) is
            u(ω) dω = k T σ(ω) dω = k T
            π2 c 3 ω2 dω. (8.108)
            This result is known as the Rayleigh-Jeans radiation law, after Lord Rayleigh and James Jeans
            who first proposed it in the late nineteenth century.
            According to Debye theory (see Section 7.14), the energy density of sound waves in a solid is
            analogous to the Rayleigh-Jeans law, with one very important difference. In Debye theory, there
            is a cut-off frequency (the Debye frequency) above which no modes exist. This cut-off comes
            about because of the discrete nature of solids (i.e., because solids are made up of atoms instead of
            being continuous). It is, of course, impossible to have sound waves whose wavelengths are much
            less than the inter-atomic spacing. On the other hand, electromagnetic waves propagate through
            a vacuum, which possesses no discrete structure. It follows that there is no cut-off frequency for
            electromagnetic waves, and so the Rayleigh-Jeans law holds for all frequencies. This immediately
            poses a severe problem. The total classical energy density of electromagnetic radiation is given by
            U =
             ∞
            0
            u(ω) dω = k T
            π2 c 3
             ∞
            0
            ω2 dω. (8.109)
            Quantum Statistics 195
            This is an integral that obviously does not converge. Thus, according to classical physics, the total
            energy density of electromagnetic radiation inside an enclosed cavity is infinite. This is clearly an
            absurd result, and was recognized as such in the latter half of the nineteenth century. In fact, this
            prediction is known as the ultra-violet catastrophe, because the Rayleigh-Jeans law usually starts
            to diverge badly from experimental observations (by over-estimating the amount of radiation) in
            the ultra-violet region of the spectrum.
            So, how do we obtain a sensible answer? As usual, quantum mechanics comes to our rescue.
            According to quantum mechanics, each allowable mode of oscillation of the electromagnetic field
            corresponds to a photon state with energy and momentum
             = ω, (8.110)
            p =  k, (8.111)
            respectively. Incidentally, it follows from Equation (8.104) that
             = p c, (8.112)
            which implies that photons are massless particles that move at the speed of light. According to the
            Planck distribution, (8.39), the mean number of photons occupying a photon state of frequency ω
            is
            nω(ω) = 1
            e β ω − 1
            . (8.113)
            Hence, the mean energy of such a state is given by
            ¯(ω) = ω nω(ω) = ω
            e β ω − 1
            . (8.114)
            Note that low-frequency states (i.e., ω  k T) behave classically: that is,
            ¯  k T. (8.115)
            On the other hand, high-frequency states (i.e., ω 
             k T) are completely “frozen out”: that is,
            ¯  k T. (8.116)
            The reason for this is simply that it is very difficult for a thermal fluctuation to create a photon with
            an energy greatly in excess of k T, because k T is the characteristic energy associated with such
            fluctuations.
            According to the previous discussion, the true energy density of electromagnetic radiation inside an enclosed cavity is written
            u¯(ω) dω = ¯(ω)σ(ω) dω, (8.117)
            giving
            u(ω) dω = 
            π2 c 3
            ω3 dω
            exp(β ω) − 1
            . (8.118)
            This is famous result is known as the Planck radiation law. The Planck law approximates to the
            classical Rayleigh-Jeans law for ω  k T, peaks at about ω  3 k T (see Exercise 8.15), and
            falls off exponentially for ω 
             k T. (See Figure 8.2.) The exponential fall off at high frequencies
            ensures that the total energy density remains finite.

            8.13 Black-Body Radiation
            Suppose that we were to make a small hole in the wall of our enclosure, and observe the emitted
            radiation. A small hole is the best approximation in physics to a black-body, which is defined as an
            object that absorbs, and, therefore, emits, radiation perfectly at all wavelengths. What is the power
            radiated by the hole? Well, the power density inside the enclosure can be written
            u(ω) dω = ω n(ω) dω, (8.119)
            where n(ω) is the mean number of photons per unit volume whose frequencies lie in the range ω
            to ω + dω. The radiation field inside the enclosure is isotropic (we are assuming that the hole is
            sufficiently small that it does not distort the field). It follows that the mean number of photons
            per unit volume whose frequencies lie in the specified range, and whose directions of propagation
            make an angle in the range θ to θ + dθ with the normal to the hole, is
            n(ω, θ) dωdθ = 1
            2 n(ω) dω sin θ dθ, (8.120)
            where sin θ is proportional to the solid angle in the specified range of directions, and
             π
            0
            n(ω, θ) dωdθ = n(ω) dω. (8.121)
            Photons travel at the velocity of light, so the power per unit area escaping from the hole in the
            frequency range ω to ω + dω is
            P(ω) dω =
             π/2
            0
            c cos θ ω n(ω, θ) dωdθ, (8.122)
            Quantum Statistics 197
            where c cos θ is the component of the photon velocity in the direction of the hole. This gives
            P(ω) dω = c u(ω) dω
            1
            2
             π/2
            0
            cos θ sin θ dθ = c
            4 u(ω) dω, (8.123)
            so
            P(ω) dω = 
            4π2 c 2
            ω3 dω
            exp(β ω) − 1 (8.124)
            is the power per unit area radiated by a black-body in the frequency range ω to ω + dω.
            A black-body is very much an idealization. The power spectra of real radiating bodies can
            deviate quite substantially from black-body spectra. Nevertheless, we can make some useful predictions using this model. The black-body power spectrum peaks when ω  3 k T. (See Exercise 8.15.) This means that the peak radiation frequency scales linearly with the temperature of
            the body. In other words, hot bodies tend to radiate at higher frequencies than cold bodies. This
            result (in particular, the linear scaling) is known as Wien’s displacement law. It allows us to estimate the surface temperatures of stars from their colors (surprisingly enough, stars are fairly good
            black-bodies). Table 8.4 shows some stellar temperatures determined by this method (in fact, the
            whole emission spectrum is fitted to a black-body spectrum). It can be seen that the apparent colors
            (which correspond quite well to the colors of the peak radiation) scan the whole visible spectrum,
            from red to blue, as the stellar surface temperatures gradually rise.

            Probably the most famous black-body spectrum is cosmological in origin. Just after the “big
            bang,” the universe was essentially a “fireball,” with the energy associated with radiation completely dominating that associated with matter. The early universe was also fairly well described
            by equilibrium statistical thermodynamics, which means that the radiation had a black-body spectrum. As the universe expanded, the radiation was gradually Doppler shifted to ever larger wavelengths (in other words, the radiation did work against the expansion of the universe, and, thereby,
            lost energy—see Exercise 8.13), but its spectrum remained invariant. Nowadays, this primordial
            radiation is detectable as a faint microwave background that pervades the whole universe. The microwave background was discovered accidentally by Penzias and Wilson in 1961. Until recently,
            it was difficult to measure the full spectrum with any degree of precision, because of strong microwave absorption and scattering by the Earth’s atmosphere. However, all of this changed when
            the COBE satellite was launched in 1989. It took precisely nine minutes to measure the perfect
            black-body spectrum reproduced in Figure 8.3. This data can be fitted to a black-body curve of

            (See Exercise 8.2.) Thus, the total power radiated per unit area by a black-body is

            . (8.128)
            Quantum Statistics 199
            This T 4 dependence of the radiated power is called the Stefan-Boltzmann law, after Josef Stefan,
            who first obtained it experimentally, and Ludwig Boltzmann, who first derived it theoretically. The

            , (8.129)
            is called the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
            We can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to estimate the temperature of the Earth from first principles. The Sun is a ball of glowing gas of radius R  7 × 105 km and surface temperature
            T  5770 K. Its luminosity is
            L = 4π R 2
             σ T 4
             , (8.130)
            according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The Earth is a globe of radius R⊕  6000 km located an
            average distance r⊕  1.5 × 108 km from the Sun. The Earth intercepts an amount of energy
            P⊕ = L
            π R 2
            ⊕ /r 2
            ⊕
            4π
            (8.131)
            per second from the Sun’s radiative output: that is, the power output of the Sun reduced by the
            ratio of the solid angle subtended by the Earth at the Sun to the total solid angle 4π. The Earth
            absorbs this energy, and then re-radiates it at longer wavelengths. The luminosity of the Earth is
            L⊕ = 4π R 2
            ⊕ σ T 4
            ⊕ , (8.132)
            according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where T⊕ is the average temperature of the Earth’s surface.
            Here, we are ignoring any surface temperature variations between polar and equatorial regions, or
            between day and night. In steady-state, the luminosity of the Earth must balance the radiative
            power input from the Sun, so equating L⊕ and P⊕ we arrive at
            T⊕ =
            
            R
            2 r⊕
            1/2
            T. (8.133)
            Remarkably, the ratio of the Earth’s surface temperature to that of the Sun depends only on the
            Earth-Sun distance and the solar radius. The previous expression yields T⊕  279 K or 6◦ C (or
            43◦ F). This is slightly on the cold side, by a few degrees, because of the greenhouse action of the
            Earth’s atmosphere, which was neglected in our calculation. Nevertheless, it is quite encouraging
            that such a crude calculation comes so close to the correct answer.
            8.15 Conduction Electrons in Metal
            The conduction electrons in a metal are non-localized (i.e., they are not tied to any particular
            atoms). In conventional metals, each atom contributes a fixed number of such electrons (corresponding to its valency). To a first approximation, it is possible to neglect the mutual interaction of
            the conduction electrons, because this interaction is largely shielded out by the stationary ions. The
            conduction electrons can, therefore, be treated as an ideal gas. However, the concentration of such
            200 8.15. Conduction Electrons in Metal
            electrons in a metal far exceeds the concentration of particles in a conventional gas. It is, therefore,
            not surprising that conduction electrons cannot normally be analyzed using classical statistics: in
            fact, they are subject to Fermi-Dirac statistics (because electrons are fermions).
            Recall, from Section 8.5, that the mean number of particles occupying state s (energy s) is
            given by
            n¯s = 1
            e β (s−µ) + 1
            , (8.134)
            according to the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Here,
            µ ≡ −k T α (8.135)
            is termed the Fermi energy of the system. This energy is determined by the condition that
            
            r
            n¯r =
            
            r
            1
            e β (r−µ) + 1 = N, (8.136)
            where N is the total number of particles contained in the volume V. It is clear, from the previous
            equation, that the Fermi energy, µ, is generally a function of the temperature, T.
            Let us investigate the behavior of the so-called Fermi function,
            F() = 1
            e β (−µ) + 1
            , (8.137)
            as  varies. Here, the energy is measured from its lowest possible value  = 0. If the Fermi energy,
            µ, is such that β µ  −1 then β ( −µ) 
             1, and F reduces to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
            However, for the case of conduction electrons in a metal, we are interested in the opposite limit,
            where
            β µ ≡
            µ
            k T
            
             1. (8.138)
            In this limit, if 0 <   µ then β ( − µ)  −1, so that F() = 1. On the other hand, if  
             µ then
            β ( − µ) 
             1, so that F() = exp[−β ( − µ)] falls off exponentially with increasing , just like a
            classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Note that F = 1/2 when  = µ. The transition region in
            which F goes from a value close to unity to a value close to zero corresponds to an energy interval
            of order k T, centered on  = µ. In fact, F = 3/4 when  = µ − (ln 3) k T, and F = 1/4 when
             = µ + (ln 3) k T. The behavior of the Fermi function is illustrated in Figure 8.4.
            In the limit as T → 0, the transition region becomes infinitesimally narrow. In this case, F = 1
            for <µ, and F = 0 for >µ, as illustrated in Figure 8.4. This is an obvious result, because
            when T = 0 the conduction electrons attain their lowest energy, or ground-state, configuration.
            Because the Pauli exclusion principle requires that there be no more than one electron per singleparticle quantum state, the lowest energy configuration is obtained by piling electrons into the
            lowest available unoccupied states, until all of the electrons are used up. Thus, the last electron
            added to the pile has a quite considerable energy,  = µ, because all of the lower energy states are
            already occupied. Clearly, the exclusion principle implies that a Fermi-Dirac gas possesses a large
            mean energy, even at absolute zero.

            Figure 8.4: The Fermi function.
            Let us calculate the Fermi energy, µ = µF, of a Fermi-Dirac gas at T = 0. The energy of each
            particle is related to its momentum p =  k via
             = p2
            2 m = 2 k 2
            2 m , (8.139)
            where k is the de Broglie wavevector. Here, m is the electron mass. At T = 0, all quantum states
            whose energy is less than the Fermi energy, µF, are filled. The Fermi energy corresponds to a
            so-called Fermi momentum, pF =  kF, which is such that
            µF = p2
            F
            2 m = 2 k 2
            F
            2 m . (8.140)
            Thus, at T = 0, all quantum states with k < kF are filled, and all those with k > kF are empty.
            Now, we know, by analogy with Equation (7.183), that there are (2π)
            −3 V allowable translational states per unit volume of k-space. The volume of the sphere of radius kF in k-space is
            (4/3) π k 3
            F. It follows that the Fermi sphere of radius kF contains (4/3) π k 3
            F (2π)
            −3 V translational
            states. The number of quantum states inside the sphere is twice this, because electrons possess
            two possible spin states for every possible translational state. Because the total number of occupied states (i.e., the total number of quantum states inside the Fermi sphere) must equal the total
            number of particles in the gas, it follows that

            1/3. All quantum states with de Broglie wavelengths
            λ ≡ 2π/k > λF are occupied at T = 0, whereas all those with λ<λF are empty.
            According to Equations (8.140) and (8.142), the Fermi energy at T = 0 takes the form
            µF = 2

            It is easily demonstrated that µF

            The majority of the conduction electrons in a metal occupy a band of completely filled states
            with energies far below the Fermi energy. In many cases, such electrons have very little effect on
            the macroscopic properties of the metal. Consider, for example, the contribution of the conduction
            electrons to the specific heat of the metal. The heat capacity at constant volume, CV, of these
            electrons can be calculated from a knowledge of their mean energy, E, as a function of T: that is,
            CV =
            
            
            ∂E
            ∂T
            
            
            V
            . (8.145)
            If the electrons obeyed classical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, so that F ∝ exp(−β ) for all electrons, then the equipartition theorem would give
            E = 3
            2 NkT, (8.146)
            CV = 3
            2 N k. (8.147)
            However, the actual situation, in which F has the form shown in Figure 8.4, is very different. A
            small change in T does not affect the mean energies of the majority of the electrons, with   µ,
            because these electrons lie in states that are completely filled, and remain so when the temperature
            is changed. It follows that these electrons contribute nothing whatsoever to the heat capacity. On
            the other hand, the relatively small number of electrons, Neff, in the energy range of order k T,
            centered on the Fermi energy, in which F is significantly different from 0 and 1, do contribute
            to the specific heat. In the tail end of this region, F ∝ exp(−β ), so the distribution reverts to a
            Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Hence, from Equation (8.147), we expect each electron in this
            region to contribute roughly an amount (3/2) k to the heat capacity. Hence, the heat capacity can
            be written
            CV  3
            2
            Neff k. (8.148)
            However, because only a fraction k T/µ of the total conduction electrons lie in the tail region of the
            Fermi-Dirac distribution, we expect
            Neff  k T
            µ

            Quantum Statistics 203
            It follows that

            2
            N k k T
            µ . (8.150)
            Because k T  µ in conventional metals, the molar specific heat of the conduction electrons
            is clearly very much less than the classical value (3/2) R. This accounts for the fact that the molar
            specific heat capacities of metals at room temperature are about the same as those of insulators.
            Before the advent of quantum mechanics, the classical theory predicted incorrectly that the presence of conduction electrons should raise the heat capacities of monovalent metals by 50 percent
            [i.e., (3/2) R] compared to those of insulators.
            Note that the specific heat (8.150) is not temperature independent. In fact, using the superscript
            e to denote the electronic specific heat, the molar specific heat can be written
            c
            (e)
            V = γ T, (8.151)
            where γ is a (positive) constant of proportionality. At room temperature c
            (e)
            V is completely masked
            by the much larger specific heat, c
            (L)
            V , due to lattice vibrations. However, at very low temperatures
            c
            (L)
            V = A T 3, where A is a (positive) constant of proportionality. (See Section 7.14.) Clearly, at low
            temperatures, c
            (L)
            V = A T 3 approaches zero far more rapidly that the electronic specific heat, as T is
            reduced. Hence, it should be possible to measure the electronic contribution to the molar specific
            heat at low temperatures.
            The total molar specific heat of a metal at low temperatures takes the form
            cV = c
            (e)
            V + c
            (L)
            V = γ T + A T 3
            . (8.152)
            Hence,
            cV
            T = γ + A T 2
            . (8.153)
            It follows that a plot of cV/T versus T 2 should yield a straight-line whose intercept on the vertical
            axis gives the coefficient γ. Figure 8.5 shows such a plot. The fact that a good straight-line is obtained verifies that the temperature dependence of the heat capacity predicted by Equation (8.152)
            is indeed correct.
            8.16 Sommerfeld Expansion
            Let us examine the conduction electrons in a metal in slightly more detail. In particular, let us try
            to obtain a more exact expression for the electronic specific heat. We saw in the previous section
            that the Fermi energy, µ, is determined by the equation

            Because, in general, the energies of the quantum states are very closely spaced, the sums in the
            previous two expressions can be replaced by integrals. Now, according to Section 8.12, the number
            of quantum states per unit volume with wavenumbers in the range k to k + dk is
            ρk(k) dk = k 2
            2π2 dk. (8.156)
            However, the energy of a state with wavenumber k is
             = 2 k 2
            2 m , (8.157)
            where m is the electron mass. Let ρ() d be the number of electrons whose energies lies in the
            range  to  + d. It follows that
            ρ() d = 2 V ρk(k)

            where the factor of 2 is to take into account the two possible spin states which exist for each

            Now, if k T  µ then F() is a constant everywhere, apart from a thin region of thickness k T,
            centered on  = µ. (See Figure 8.4.) It follows that F
            () is approximately zero everywhere, apart

            8.17 White-Dwarf Stars
            A main-sequence hydrogen-burning star, such as the Sun, is maintained in equilibrium via the
            balance of the gravitational attraction tending to make it collapse, and the thermal pressure tending
            to make it expand. Of course, the thermal energy of the star is generated by nuclear reactions
            occurring deep inside its core. Eventually, however, the star will run out of burnable fuel, and will,
            therefore, start to collapse, as it radiates away its remaining thermal energy. What is the ultimate
            fate of such a star?
            A burnt-out star is basically a gas of electrons and ions. As the star collapses, its density increases, so the mean separation between its constituent particles decreases. Eventually, the mean
            separation becomes of order the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons, and the electron gas becomes degenerate. Note, that the de Broglie wavelength of the ions is much smaller than that of the
            electrons (because of the ions’ much larger mass), so the ion gas remains non-degenerate. Now,
            even at zero temperature, a degenerate electron gas exerts a substantial pressure, because the Pauli
            exclusion principle prevents the mean electron separation from becoming significantly smaller than
            the typical de Broglie wavelength. (See Section 8.15 and Exercise 8.18.) Thus, it is possible for a
            burnt-out star to maintain itself against complete collapse under gravity via the degeneracy pressure of its constituent electrons. Such stars are termed white-dwarfs. Let us investigate the physics
            of white-dwarfs in more detail.
            The total energy of a white-dwarf star can be written
            E = K + U, (8.192)
            Quantum Statistics 209
            where K is the total kinetic energy of the degenerate electrons (the kinetic energy of the ions is
            negligible), and U is the gravitational potential energy. Let us assume, for the sake of simplicity,
            that the density of the star is uniform. In this case, the gravitational potential energy takes the form
            U = −3
            5
            G M 2
            R , (8.193)
            where G is the gravitational constant, M the stellar mass, and R the stellar radius.
            Let us assume that the electron gas is highly degenerate, which is equivalent to taking the limit
            T → 0. In this case, we know, from Section 8.15, that the Fermi momentum can be written

            where R = 7 × 105 km is the solar radius, and M = 2 × 1030 kg the solar mass. It follows
            that the radius of a typical solar-mass white-dwarf is about 7000 km: that is, about the same as
            the radius of the Earth. The first white-dwarf to be discovered (in 1862) was the companion of
            Sirius. Nowadays, thousands of white-dwarfs have been observed, all with properties similar to
            those described previously.
            8.18 Chandrasekhar Limit
            One curious feature of white-dwarf stars is that their radius decreases as their mass increases.
            [See Equation (8.206).] It follows, from Equation (8.199), that the mean energy of the degenerate
            electrons inside the star increases strongly as the stellar mass increases: in fact, K ∝ M 7/3. Hence,
            if M becomes sufficiently large then the electrons become relativistic, and the previous analysis
            needs to be modified. Strictly speaking, the non-relativistic analysis described in the previous
            section is only valid in the low-mass limit M  M. Let us, for the sake of simplicity, consider
            the ultra-relativistic limit in which p

            As before, the equilibrium radius R∗ is that which minimizes the total energy. E. However, in the
            ultra-relativistic case, a non-zero value of R∗ only exists for A−B > 0. When A−B < 0, the energy
            decreases monotonically with decreasing stellar radius. In other words, the degeneracy pressure of
            the electrons is incapable of halting the collapse of the star under gravity. The criterion that must
            be satisfied for a relativistic white-dwarf star to be maintained against gravity is that
            A
            B
            > 1. (8.214)
            This criterion can be re-written

            realistic calculation, which does not assume constant density, yields
            MC = 1.4 M. (8.217)
            Thus, if the stellar mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit then the star in question cannot become
            a white-dwarf when its nuclear fuel is exhausted, but, instead, must continue to collapse. What is
            the ultimate fate of such a star?
            8.19 Neutron Stars
            At stellar densities that greatly exceed white-dwarf densities, the extreme pressures cause electrons
            to combine with protons to form neutrons. Thus, any star that collapses to such an extent that its
            212 8.20. Bose-Einstein Condensation
            radius becomes significantly less than that characteristic of a white-dwarf is effectively transformed
            into a gas of neutrons. Eventually, the mean separation between the neutrons becomes comparable
            with their de Broglie wavelength. At this point, it is possible for the degeneracy pressure of the
            neutrons to halt the collapse of the star. A star that is maintained against gravity in this manner is
            called a neutron star.
            Neutrons stars can be analyzed in a very similar manner to white-dwarf stars. In fact, the
            previous analysis can be simply modified by letting mp → mp/2 and m → mp. Thus, we conclude
            that non-relativistic neutrons stars satisfy the mass-radius law:
            R∗
            R
            = 0.000011 
            M
            M
            1/3
            , (8.218)
            It follows that the radius of a typical solar mass neutron star is a mere 10 km. In 1967, Antony
            Hewish and Jocelyn Bell discovered a class of compact radio sources, called pulsars, that emit
            extremely regular pulses of radio waves. Pulsars have subsequently been identified as rotating
            neutron stars. To date, many hundreds of these objects have been observed.
            When relativistic effects are taken into account, it is found that there is a critical mass above
            which a neutron star cannot be maintained against gravity. According to our analysis, this critical
            mass, which is known as the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, is given by
            MOV = 4 MC = 6.9 M. (8.219)
            A more realistic calculation, which does not assume constant density, does not treat the neutrons
            as point particles, and takes general relativity into account, gives a somewhat lower value of
            MOV = 1.5–2.5 M. (8.220)
            A star whose mass exceeds the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit cannot be maintained against gravity
            by degeneracy pressure, and must ultimately collapse to form a black-hole.
            8.20 Bose-Einstein Condensation
            Consider a gas of weakly-interacting bosons. It is helpful to define the gas’s chemical potential,
            µ = k T α, (8.221)
            whose value is determined by the equation
            N =
            
            r
            n¯r =
            
            r
            1
            e β (r−µ) − 1
            . (8.222)
            Here, N is the total number of particles, and r the energy of the single-particle quantum state r.
            Because, in general, the energies of the quantum states are very closely spaced, the sum in the
            Quantum Statistics 213
            previous expression can approximated as an integral. Now, according to Section 8.12, the number
            of quantum states per unit volume with wavenumbers in the range k to k + dk is
            ρk(k) dk = k 2
            2π2 dk. (8.223)
            However, the energy of a state with wavenumber k is
             = 2 k 2
            2 m , (8.224)
            where m is the boson mass. Let ρ() d be the number of bosons whose energies lies in the range
             to  + d. It follows that
            ρ() d = V ρk(k)
            dk
            d
            d, (8.225)
            where V is the volume of the gas. Here, we are assuming that the bosons are spinless, so that there
            is only one particle state per translational state. Hence,
            ρ() = V
            4π2
            (2 m)
            3/2
            3  1/2
            , (8.226)
            and Equation (8.222) becomes
            N =
             ∞
            0
            ρ()
            e β (−µ) − 1 d = V
            4π2
            (2 m)
            3/2

            0
             1/2
            e β (−µ) − 1 d. (8.227)
            However, there is a significant flaw in this formulation. In using the integral approximation, rather
            than performing the sum, the ground-state,  = 0, has been left out [because ρ(0) = 0]. Under
            ordinary circumstances, this omission does not matter. However, at very low temperatures, bosons
            tend to condense into the ground-state, and the occupation number of this state becomes very much
            larger than that of any other state. Under these circumstances, the ground-state must be included
            in the calculation.
            We can overcome the previous difficulty in the following manner. Let there be N0 bosons in
            the ground-state, and Nex in the various excited states, so that
            N = N0 + Nex. (8.228)
            Because the ground-state is excluded from expression (8.227), the integral only gives the number
            of bosons in excited states. In other words,
            Nex = V
            4π2
            (2 m)
            3/2

             1/2
            e β (−µ) − 1 d. (8.229)
            Now, because the ground-state has zero energy, its mean occupancy number is
            N0 = 1
            e−µ/k T − 1
            . (8.230)
            214 8.20. Bose-Einstein Condensation
            Moreover, at temperatures very close to absolute zero, we expect N0  N, which implies that
            N  1
            e−µ/k T − 1
            . (8.231)
            We conclude that

            N, (8.232)
            for large N. Hence, at very low temperatures, we can safely set exp(−µ/k T) equal to unity in
            Equation (8.229). Thus, we obtain
            Nex = 2

            where x = /(k T). The value of the integral is Γ(3/2) ζ(3/2), where Γ(s) =  ∞
            0 x s−1 e−x dx is a
            Gamma function, and ζ(s) = 
            n=1,∞ n−s a Riemann zeta function. (See Exercise 8.4.) Furthermore,
            Γ(3/2) = √
            π/2, and ζ(3/2) = 2.612. Hence,
            Nex = ζ(3/2) V

            h2
            3/2
            . (8.234)
            The so-called Bose temperature, TB, is defined as the temperature above which all the bosons
            are in excited states. Setting Nex = N and T = TB in the previous expression, we obtain
            TB = h2

            ζ(3/2) V

            Moreover,

            Thus, the fractional number of bosons in the ground-state is

            Obviously, the preceding two equations are only valid for 0 < T < TB. For T > TB, we have
            N0/N = 0 and Nex/N = 1. Moreover, for 0 < T < TB we have µ/k TB = 0, whereas for T > TB,
            combining Equations (8.229) (with Nex = N) and (8.235) yields

            Let us estimate a typical value of the Bose temperature. Consider a boson gas made up of
            NA/10 = 6.02 × 1022 He4 atoms confined to a volume of 1 litre. The mass of a He4 atom is
            6.65 × 10−27 kg. Making use of Equation (8.235), we obtain
            TB = (6.63 × 10−34) 2
            2π (6.65 × 10−27) (1.38 × 10−23)

             2/3
            = 0.062 K. (8.241)
            At atmospheric pressure, helium liquifies at 4.12 K, long before the Bose temperature is reached.
            In fact, all real gases liquify before the Bose temperature is reached.
            Figure 8.7 shows the variation of N0/N and Nex/N with T/TB. A corresponding graph of µ/k TB
            [numerically determined from Equation (8.240) when T > TB] is shown in Figure 8.8. The sudden
            collapse of bosons into the ground-state at temperatures below the Bose temperature is known as
            Bose-Einstein condensation. In 1995, E.A. Cornell and C.E. Wieman led a team of physicists
            that created a nearly pure condensate by cooling a vapor of rubidium atoms to a temperature of
            1.3 × 10−7 K. (Cornell and Wieman were subsequently awarded the Nobel prize in 2001.)

            As before, we can approximate the sum as an integral, and write
            E =

            e β (r−µ) − 1
            d. (8.243)
            In this case, we do not need to worry about the omission of the ground-state in the integral, because
            this state makes no contribution to the mean energy (because  = 0 in the ground-state). For
            temperatures above the Bose temperature, all the bosons are in excited states, and we expect the
            mean energy to approach the classical value, (3/2) NkT. However, below the Bose temperature,
            a substantial fraction of bosons are in the ground-state, so we expect the mean energy to fall well
            below the classical value.
            As we have seen, the chemical potential of a boson gas is very close to zero for temperatures
            below the Bose temperature. Hence, setting µ = 0 in the previous expression, and making the
            substitution x = /(k T), we obtain

            that the energy approaches its classical value asymptotically in the limit T 
             TB. Finally, Figure 8.10 shows how the molar heat capacity of a boson gas varies with temperature. It can be seen
            that the cV curve has a change in slope at T = TB, reaching a maximum value there of 1.92 R. At
            higher temperatures, cV approaches the classical value, (3/2) R, asymptotically.

            a time-varying electric dipole moment, p. Assuming that the molecule is located at the

            generates a force f = ∇[p · E(r)] acting on the second molecule. (Of course, an equal
            and opposite force acts on the first molecule.) Use these facts to deduce that the mean (i.e.,
            averaged over time, and all possible orientations of p) inter-molecular potential between a

            9 Multi-Phase Systems
            9.1 Introduction
            Up to now, we have dealt, almost exclusively, with systems consisting of a single phase (i.e., a
            single, spatially homogeneous, state of aggregation). In this chapter, we shall employ statistical
            thermodynamics to investigate the equilibria of multi-phase systems (e.g., ice and water). Most of
            our analysis turns out to be independent of the microscopic details of such systems, and, therefore,
            leads to fairly general results.
            9.2 Equilibrium of Isolated System
            Consider a thermally isolated system, A. According to Section 5.6, any spontaneously occurring
            process is such that the system’s entropy tends to increase in time. In statistical terms, this means
            that the system evolves toward a situation of greater intrinsic probability. Thus, in any spontaneous
            process, the change in entropy satisfies
            ∆S ≥ 0. (9.1)
            It follows that if a stable equilibrium state has been attained [i.e., one in which no further spontaneous processes (other than random fluctuations) can take place] then this state is such that S
            is maximized. In other words, it is the most probable state of the system, subject to the given
            constraints. Thus, we can make the following statement:
            For a thermally isolated system, the stable equilibrium state is such that
            S = maximum.
            Now, in a thermally isolated system, the first law of thermodynamics implies that
            0 = Q = W + ∆E, (9.2)
            or
            W =
            
            −∆E
            
            . (9.3)
            If the external parameters of the system (e.g., its volume) are kept fixed, so that no work is done
            (i.e., W = 0), then
            E = constant (9.4)
            as S evolves toward its maximum value.
            We can phrase the previous argument in more explicit statistical terms. Suppose that an isolated
            system is described by a parameter y (or by several such parameters), but that its total energy is
            constant. Let Ω(y) denote the number of microstates accessible to the system when this parameter
            lies between y and y + δy (δy being some fixed small interval). The corresponding entropy of the
            228 9.3. Equilibrium of Constant-Temperature System
            system is S = k ln Ω. (See Section 5.6.) If the parameter y is free to vary then the principle of
            equal a priori probabilities asserts that, in an equilibrium state, the probability, P(y), of finding the
            system with the parameter between y and y + δy is given by
            P(y) ∝ Ω(y) = exp 
            S (y)
            k
            
            . (9.5)
            (See Section 3.3.) The previous expression shows explicitly that the most probable state is one
            in which S attains a maximum value, and also allows us to determine the relative probability of
            fluctuations about this state.
            9.3 Equilibrium of Constant-Temperature System
            A knowledge of the equilibrium conditions for an isolated system permits us to deduce similar
            conditions for other situations of physical interest. For instance, much experimental work is performed under conditions of constant temperature. Thus, it would be interesting to investigate the
            equilibrium of some system, A, in thermal contact with a heat reservoir, A
            , that is held at the
            constant absolute temperature T0.
            The combined system, A(0), consisting of the system A and the heat reservoir A
            , is an isolated
            system of the type discussed in the previous section. The entropy, S (0), of A(0) therefore satisfies
            condition (9.1). In other words, in any spontaneous process,
            ∆S (0) ≥ 0. (9.6)
            However, this condition can also be expressed in terms of quantities that only refer to the system
            A. In fact,
            ∆S (0) = ∆S + ∆S 
            , (9.7)
            where ∆S is the entropy change of A, and ∆S  that of the reservoir. But, if A absorbs heat Q from
            the reservoir A during the process then A absorbs heat (−Q), and suffers a corresponding entropy
            change
            ∆S  = (−Q)
            T0
            (9.8)
            (because it remains in equilibrium at the constant temperature T0). Furthermore, the first law of
            thermodynamics implies that
            Q = ∆E + W, (9.9)
            where ∆E is the change in internal energy of A, and W is the work done by A. Thus, Equation (9.7)
            can be written
            ∆S (0) = ∆S − Q
            T0
            = T0 ∆S − (∆E + W)

            or
            ∆S (0) = −∆F0 − W

            , (9.11)
            Multi-Phase Systems 229
            where use has been made of the fact that T0 is a constant. Here,
            F0 ≡ E − T0 S, (9.12)
            reduces to the Helmholtz free energy, F = E −T S , of system A, when the latter has a temperature,
            T, equal to that of the heat reservoir, A
            . Of course, in the general case in which A is not in
            equilibrium with A
            , the former system’s temperature is not necessarily equal to T0.
            The fundamental condition (9.6) can be combined with Equation (9.11) to give
            W ≤ (−∆F0) (9.13)
            (assuming that T0 is positive, as is normally the case). This relation implies that the maximum
            work that can be done by a system in contact with a heat reservoir is (−∆F0). (Incidentally, this is
            the reason for the name “free energy” given to F.) The maximum work corresponds to the equality
            sign in the preceding equation, and is obtained when the process used is quasi-static (so that A is
            always in equilibrium with A
            , and T = T0). Equation (9.13) should be compared to the rather
            different relation (9.3) that pertains to an isolated system.
            If the external parameters of system A are held constant then W = 0, and Equation (9.13) yields
            the condition
            ∆F0 ≤ 0. (9.14)
            This equation is analogous to Equation (9.1) for an isolated system. It implies that if a system is
            in thermal contact with a heat reservoir then its Helmholtz free energy tends to decrease. Thus, we
            arrive at the following statement:
            If a system, whose external parameters are fixed, is in thermal contact with a heat
            reservoir then the stable equilibrium state is such that
            F0 = minimum.
            The preceding statement can again be phrased in more explicit statistical terms. Suppose that
            the external parameters of A are fixed, so that W = 0. Furthermore, let A be described by some
            parameter y. The thermodynamic functions of A—namely, S and E—have the definite values
            S (y1) and E(y1), respectively, when y has a given value y = y1. If the parameter changes to some
            other value, y, then these functions change by the corresponding amounts ∆S = S (y) − S (y1) and
            ∆E = E(y)−E(y1) = Q. The entropy of the heat reservoir, A
            , also changes because it absorbs heat.
            The corresponding change in the total entropy of A(0) is given by Equation (9.11) (with W = 0):
            ∆S (0) = −∆F0
            T0
            . (9.15)
            But, in an equilibrium state, the probability, P(y), that the parameter lies between y and y + δy is
            proportional to the number of states, Ω(0)(y), accessible to the isolated total system, A(0), when the
            parameter lies in this range. Thus, by analogy with Equation (9.5), we have
            P(y) ∝ Ω(0)(y) = exp 

            . (9.17)
            Now, because y1 is just some arbitrary constant, the corresponding constant terms can be absorbed
            into the constant of proportionality in Equation (9.16), which then becomes
            P(y) ∝ exp 

            This equation shows explicitly that the most probable state is one in which F0 attains a minimum
            value, and also allows us to determine the relative probability of fluctuations about this state.
            9.4 Equilibrium of Constant-Temperature Constant-Pressure System
            Another case of physical interest is that where a system, A, is maintained under conditions of
            both constant temperature and constant pressure. This is a situation that occurs frequently in the
            laboratory, where we might carry out an experiment in a thermostat at atmospheric pressure (say).
            Therefore, let us suppose that A is in thermal contact with a heat reservoir, A
            , that is held at the
            constant temperature T0, and at the constant pressure p0. The system A can exchange heat with
            the reservoir, A
            , but the latter is so large that its temperature, T0, remains constant. Likewise, the
            system A can change its volume, V, at the expense of that of the reservoir, A
            , doing work on the
            reservoir in the process. However, A is so large that its pressure, p0, remains unaffected by this
            relatively small volume change.
            The analysis of the equilibrium conditions for system A follows similar lines to the that in the
            previous section. The entropy, S (0), of the combined system A(0) = A + A satisfies the condition
            that in any spontaneous process
            ∆S (0) = ∆S + ∆S  ≥ 0. (9.19)
            If A absorbs heat Q from A in this process then ∆S  = −Q/T0. Furthermore, the first law of
            thermodynamics yields
            Q = ∆E + p0 ∆V + W ∗
            , (9.20)
            where p0 ∆V is the work done by A against the constant pressure, p0, of the reservoir, A
            , and where
            W ∗ denotes any other work done by A in the process. (For example, W ∗ might refer to electrical
            work.) Thus, we can write
            ∆S (0) = ∆S − Q
            T0
            = T0 ∆S − (∆E + p0 ∆V + W ∗
            )
            T0
            = ∆(T0 S − E − p0 V) − W ∗
            T0
            , (9.21)
            or
            ∆S (0) = −∆G0 − W ∗
            T0
            . (9.22)
            Here, we have made use of the fact that T0 and p0 are constants. We have also introduced the
            definition
            G0 ≡ E − T0 S + p0 V, (9.23)
            Multi-Phase Systems 231
            where G0 becomes the Gibbs free energy, G = E − T S + p V, of system A when the temperature
            and pressure of this system are both equal to those of the reservoir, A
            .
            The fundamental condition (9.19) can be combined with Equation (9.22) to give
            W ∗ ≤ (−∆G0) (9.24)
            (assuming that T0 is positive). This relation implies that the maximum work (other than the work
            done on the pressure reservoir) that can be done by system A is (−∆G0). (Incidentally, this is the
            reason that G is also called a “free energy”.) The maximum work corresponds to the equality sign
            in the preceding equation, and is obtained when the process used is quasi-static (so that A is always
            in equilibrium with A
            , and T = T0, p = p0).
            If the external parameters of system A (except its volume) are held constant then W ∗ = 0, and
            Equation (9.24) yields the condition
            ∆G0 ≤ 0. (9.25)
            Thus, we arrive at the following statement:
            If a system is in contact with a reservoir at constant temperature and pressure then the
            stable equilibrium state is such that
            G0 = minimum.
            The preceding statement can again be phrased in more explicit statistical terms. Suppose that
            the external parameters of A (except its volume) are fixed, so that W ∗ = 0. Furthermore, let A be
            described by some parameter y. If y changes from some standard value y1 then the corresponding
            change in the total entropy of A(0) is
            ∆S (0) = −∆G0
            T0
            . (9.26)
            But, in an equilibrium state, the probability, P(y), that the parameter lies between y and y + δy is
            given by
            P(y) ∝ exp 
            S (0)(y)
            k
            
            . (9.27)
            Now, from Equation (9.26),
            S (0)(y) = S (0)(y1) − ∆G0
            T0
            = S (0)(y1) −
            
            G0(y) − G0(y1)
            T0
            
            . (9.28)
            However, because y1 is just some arbitrary constant, the corresponding constant terms can be
            absorbed into the constant of proportionality in Equation (9.27), which then becomes
            P(y) ∝ exp 
            −G0(y)
            k T0
            
            . (9.29)
            This equation shows explicitly that the most probable state is one in which G0 attains a minimum
            value, and also allows us to determine the relative probability of fluctuations about this state.
            232 9.5. Stability of Single-Phase Substance
            9.5 Stability of Single-Phase Substance
            Consider a system in a single phase (e.g., a liquid or a solid). Let us focus attention on a small, but
            macroscopic part, A, of this system. Here, A consists of a fixed number of particles, N 
             1. The
            remainder of the system is, relatively, very large, and, therefore, acts like a reservoir held at some
            constant temperature, T0, and constant pressure, p0. According to Equation (9.25), the condition
            for stable equilibrium, applied to A, is
            G0 ≡ E − T0 S + p0 V = minimum. (9.30)
            Let the temperature, T, and the volume, V, be the two independent parameters that specify the
            macrostate of A. Consider, first, a situation where V is fixed, but T is allowed to vary. Suppose
            that the minimum of G0 occurs for T = T˜, when G0 = Gmin. Expanding G0 about its minimum,
            and writing ∆T = T − T˜, we obtain
            ∆mG0 ≡ G0 − Gmin =
            
            ∂G0

            V
            (∆T) 2 + ··· . (9.31)
            Here, all derivatives are evaluated at T = T˜. Because G0 = Gmin is a stationary point (i.e., a
            maximum or a minimum), ∆mG0 = 0 to first order in ∆T. In other words,
            
            ∂G0
            ∂T
            
            V
            = 0 for T = T˜. (9.32)
            Furthermore, because G0 = Gm is a minimum, rather than a maximum, ∆mG0 ≥ 0 to second order
            in ∆T. In other words,
            
            ∂2

            V
            ≥ 0 for T = T˜. (9.33)
            According to Equation (9.30), the condition, (9.32), that G0 be stationary yields
            
            ∂G0
            ∂T

            However, the fundamental thermodynamic relation
            T dS = dE + p dV ¯ (9.35)
            implies that if V is fixed then
            T

            Thus, Equation (9.34) becomes

            Recalling that the derivatives are evaluated at T = T˜, we get
            T˜ = T0. (9.38)
            Thus, we arrive at the rather obvious conclusion that a necessary condition for equilibrium is that
            the temperature of the subsystem A be the same as that of the surrounding medium.
            Equations (9.33) and (9.37) imply that

            Recalling that the derivatives are evaluated at T = T˜, and that T˜ = T0, the second term on the
            right-hand side of the previous equation vanishes, and we obtain
            
            

            V
            ≥ 0. (9.40)
            However, this derivative is simply the heat capacity, CV, at constant volume. Thus, we deduce that
            a fundamental criterion for the stability of any phase is
            CV ≥ 0. (9.41)
            The previous condition is a particular example of a very general rule, known as Le Ch´atelier’s
            principle, which states that
            If a system is in a stable equilibrium then any spontaneous change of its parameters
            must give rise to processes that tend to restore the system to equilibrium.
            To show how this principle applies to the present case, suppose that the temperature, T, of the
            subsystem A has increased above that of its surroundings, A
            , as a result of a spontaneous fluctuation. The process brought into play is the spontaneous flow of heat from system A, at the higher
            temperature, to its surroundings A
            , which brings about a decrease in the energy, E, of A (i.e.,
            ∆E < 0). By Le Ch´atelier’s principle, this energy decrease must act to decrease the temperature
            of A (i.e., ∆T < 0), so as to restore A to its equilibrium state (in which its temperature is the same
            as its surroundings). Hence, it follows that ∆E and ∆T have the same sign, so that ∆E/∆T > 0, in
            agreement with Equation (9.40).
            Suppose, now, that the temperature of subsystem A is fixed at T = T0, but that its volume, V, is
            allowed to vary. We can write
            ∆mG0 =

            value. The condition that G0 is stationary yields

            the volume of A back towards its equilibrium value. In other words, ∆V and ∆p¯ must have opposite
            signs, implying that κT > 0.
            The preceding discussion allows us to characterize the spontaneous volume fluctuations of the
            small subsystem A. The most probable situation is that where V takes the value V˜ that minimizes
            G0, so that G0(V˜ ) = Gmin. Let P(V) dV denote the probability that the volume of A lies between V
            and V + dV. According to Equation (9.29),
            P(V) dV ∝ exp 

            k T0
            
            dV. (9.53)
            However, when ∆V = V − V˜ is small, the expansion (9.42) is applicable. By virtue of Equations (9.43), (9.50), and (9.51), the expansion yields
            G0(V) = G0(V˜ ) − 1

            Thus, Equation (9.53) becomes

            where we have absorbed Gmin into the constant of proportionality, B. Of course, B can be determined via the requirement that the integral of P(V) dV over all possible values of the volume, V,
            be equal to unity.
            The probability distribution (9.55) is a Gaussian whose maximum lies at V = V˜ . Thus, V˜ is
            equal to the mean volume, V. Moreover, the standard deviation of the spontaneous fluctuations of
            V about its mean value is

            (See Section 2.9.) The fluctuations in V imply corresponding fluctuations in the number of particles
            per unit volume, n = N/V, (and, hence, in the mean density) of the subsystem A. The fluctuations
            in n are centered on the mean value ¯n = N/V. For relatively small fluctuations, ∆n ≡ n − n¯ 

            Note that the relative magnitudes of the density and volume fluctuations are inversely proportional
            to the square-root of the volume, V, under consideration.

            In this limit, κT → ∞, and the density fluctuations become very large. [They do not, however,
            become infinite, because the neglect of third-order, and higher, terms in the expansion (9.42) is no

            longer justified.] The condition (∂p¯/∂V)T = 0 defines the so-called critical point of the substance,
            at which the distinction between its liquid and gas phases disappears. (See Section 9.10.) The
            very large density fluctuations at the critical point lead to strong scattering of light. As a result, a
            substance that is ordinarily transparent will assume a milky-white appearance at its critical point
            (e.g., CO2 when it approaches its critical point at 304 K and 73 atmospheres). This interesting
            phenomenon is called critical-point opalecance.
            9.6 Equilibrium Between Phases
            Consider a system that consists of two phases, which we shall denote by 1 and 2. For example,
            these might be solid and liquid, or liquid and gas. Suppose that the system is in equilibrium with
            a reservoir at the constant temperature T, and the constant pressure p, so that the system always
            has the temperature T and the mean pressure p. However, the system can exist in either one of its
            two phases, or some mixture of the two. Let us begin by finding the conditions that allow the two
            phases to coexist in equilibrium with one another.
            In accordance with the discussion in Section 9.4, the equilibrium condition is that the Gibbs
            free energy, G, of the system is a minimum:
            G = E − T S + p V = minimum. (9.59)
            Let νi be the number of moles of phase i present in the system, and let gi(T, p) be the Gibbs free
            energy per mole of phase i at the temperature T and the pressure p. It follows that
            G = ν1 g1 + ν2 g2. (9.60)
            Furthermore, the conservation of matter implies that the total number of moles, ν, of the substance
            remains constant:
            ν1 + ν2 = ν = constant. (9.61)
            Thus, we can take ν1 as the one independent parameter that is free to vary. In equilibrium, Equation (9.59) requires that G be stationary for small variations in ν1. In other words,
            dG = g1 dν1 + g2 dν2 = (g1 − g2) dν1 = 0, (9.62)
            because dν2 = −dν1, as a consequence of Equation (9.61). Hence, a necessary condition for
            equilibrium between the two phases is
            g1 = g2. (9.63)
            Clearly, when this condition is satisfied then the transfer of a mole of substance from one phase to
            another does not change the overall Gibbs free energy, G, of the system. Hence, G is stationary,
            as required. Incidentally, the condition that G is a minimum (rather than a maximum) is easily
            shown to reduce to the requirement that the heat capacities and isothermal compressibilities of
            both phases be positive, so that each phase is stable to temperature and volume fluctuations.
            Now, for a given temperature and pressure, g1(T, p) is a well-defined function characteristic
            of phase 1. Likewise, g2(T, p) is a well-defined function characteristic of phase 2. If T and p are

            such that g1 < g2 then the minimum value of G in Equation (9.59) is achieved when all ν moles
            of the substance transform into phase 1, so that G = ν g1. In this case, phase 1 is the stable one.
            On the other hand, if g1 > g2 then the minimum value of G is achieved when all ν moles of the
            substance transform into phase 2, so that G = ν g2. In this case, phase 2 is the stable one. Finally,
            if g1 = g2 then the condition (9.59) is automatically satisfied, and any amount, ν1, of phase 1 can
            coexist with the remaining amount, ν2 = ν−ν1, of phase 2. The locus of the points in the T-p plane
            where g1 = g2 then represents a phase-equilibrium line along which the two phases can coexist in
            equilibrium. This line divides the T-p plane into two regions. The first corresponds to g1 < g2, so
            that phase 1 is stable. The second corresponds to g1 > g2, so that phase 2 is stable. See Figure 9.1.
            9.7 Clausius-Clapeyron Equation
            It is possible to characterize the phase-equilibrium line in terms of a differential equation. Referring
            to Figure 9.1, consider a point, such as A, that lies on the phase-equilibrium line, and corresponds
            to the temperature T and the pressure p. The condition (9.63) implies that
            g1(T, p) = g2(T, p). (9.64)
            Now, consider a neighboring point, such as B, that also lies on the phase-equilibrium line, and
            corresponds to the temperature T + dT and the pressure p + d p. The condition (9.63) yields
            g1(T + dT, p + d p) = g2(T + dT, p + d p). (9.65)
            Taking the difference between the previous two equations, we obtain
            dg1 = dg2, (9.66)

            d p (9.67)
            is the change in Gibbs free energy per mole of phase i in going from point A to point B.
            The change, dg, for each phase can also be obtained from the fundamental thermodynamic
            relation
            d = T ds − p dv. (9.68)
            Here,  refers to molar energy (i.e., energy per mole), s to molar entropy, and v to molar volume.
            Thus,
            dg ≡ d( − T s + p v) = −s dT + v d p. (9.69)
            Hence, Equation (9.66) implies that
            −s1 dT + v1 d p = −s2 dT + v2 d p, (9.70)
            or
            (s2 − s1) dT = (v2 − v2) d p, (9.71)
            which reduces to
            d p
            dT = ∆s
            ∆v, (9.72)
            where ∆s ≡ s2 − s1 and ∆v ≡ v2 − v1. This result is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.
            Consider any point on the phase-equilibrium line at temperature T and pressure p. The ClausiusClapeyron equation then relates the local slope of the line to the molar entropy change, ∆s, and the
            molar volume change, ∆v, of the substance in crossing the line at this point. Note, incidentally, that
            the quantities on the right-hand side of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation do not necessarily need to
            refer to one mole of the substance. In fact, both numerator and denominator can be multiplied by
            the same number of moles, leaving d p/dT unchanged.
            Because there is an entropy change associated with a phase transformation, heat must also be
            absorbed during such a process. The latent heat of transformation, L12, is defined as the heat
            absorbed when a given amount of phase 1 is transformed to phase 2. Because this process takes
            place at the constant temperature T, the corresponding entropy change is
            ∆S = S 2 − S 1 = L12
            T , (9.73)
            where L12 is the latent heat at this temperature. Thus, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, (9.72), can
            also be written
            d p
            dT = ∆S
            ∆V = L12
            T ∆V . (9.74)
            9.8 Phase Diagrams
            Simple substances are capable of existing in three different types of phase: namely, solid, liquid,
            and gas. (There may actually be several solid phases with different crystal structures.) In the T-p

            plane, the phase-equilibrium lines separating these phases typically appear as indicated in Figure 9.2. These lines separate solid from liquid, liquid from gas, and solid from gas. The gas phase
            is sometimes called the vapor phase. The transformation from solid to liquid is called melting, that
            from liquid to gas is called vaporization, and that from solid to gas is called sublimation. The three
            phase-equilibrium lines meet at one common point, A, known as the triple point. At this unique
            temperature and pressure, arbitrary amounts of all three phases can coexist in equilibrium. (This is
            the property that makes the triple point of water so suitable as a readily reproducible temperature
            standard.) At point B, the so-called critical point, the liquid-gas equilibrium line ends. The volume
            change, ∆V, between the liquid and gas phases is zero at this point. Beyond point B, there is no
            further phase transformation, because there exists a single fluid phase (i.e., the very dense gas has
            become indistinguishable from the liquid.)
            In going from solid (s) to liquid (l), the entropy (or degree of disorder) of the substance almost
            always increases. Thus, the corresponding latent heat, Lsl, is positive, and heat is absorbed in
            the transformation. In most cases, the solid expands upon melting, so ∆V > 0. In this case, the
            Clausius-Clapeyron equation, (9.74), asserts that the slope of the solid-liquid equilibrium line (i.e.,
            the melting curve) is positive, as shown in the diagram. However, there exist some substances,
            such as water, that contract upon melting, so that ∆V < 0. For these substances, the slope of the
            melting curve is negative.
            9.9 Vapor Pressure
            The Clausius-Clapeyron equation can be used to derive an approximate expression for the pressure
            of the vapor in equilibrium with the liquid (or solid) at some temperature T. This pressure is called
            240 9.10. Phase Transformations in Van der Waals Fluid
            the vapor pressure of the liquid (or solid) at this temperature. According to Equation (9.74),
            d p
            dT = l
            T ∆v, (9.75)
            where l = l12 is the latent heat per mole, and v the molar volume. Let 1 refer to the liquid (or solid)
            phase, and 2 to the vapor. It follows that
            ∆v = v2 − v1  v2, (9.76)
            because the vapor is much less dense than the liquid, so that v2 
             v1. Let us also assume that the
            vapor can be adequately treated as an ideal gas, so that its equation of state is written
            p v2 = R T. (9.77)
            Thus, ∆v  R T/p, and Equation (9.75) becomes

            p
            d p
            dT = 1
            R T 2 . (9.78)
            Assuming that l is approximately temperature independent, we can integrate the previous equation
            to give
            ln p = − l
            R T
            + constant, (9.79)
            which implies that
            p = p0 exp 
            − l
            R T 
            , (9.80)
            where p0 is some constant. This result shows that the vapor pressure, p, is a very rapidly increasing
            function of the temperature, T.
            9.10 Phase Transformations in Van der Waals Fluid
            Consider a so-called van der Waals fluid whose equation of state takes the form
            
            
            p +
            a
            v 2
            
            (v − b) = R T, (9.81)
            where a > 0, b > 0 are constants, and v is the molar volume. (See Sections 6.15 and 8.11.) It is
            helpful to write this equation of state in the reduced form
            p = 8
            3
            T
            v − 1/3 − 3
            v 2 , (9.82)
            where p = p/pc, T = T
            /Tc, and v = v/vc. Here, the critical pressure, temperature and molar
            volume are pc = a/(27 b2
            ), Tc = 8 a/(27 R b), and vc = 3 b, respectively. (See Section 6.15.)
            Figure 9.3 shows the isotherms of the van der Waals equation of state plotted in the v
            -p plane.
            It can be seen that, for temperatures that exceed the critical temperature (i.e., T > 1), reducing the

            isotherm has a point of inflection.
            molar volume of the fluid causes its pressure to rise monotonically, eventually becoming infinite
            when v = 1/3 (i.e., when the molecules are closely packed). On the other hand, for temperatures
            less than the critical temperature (i.e., T < 1), as v is decreased the pressure rises, falls, and then
            rises again, which seems to imply that, for some molar volumes, compressing the fluid can cause
            its pressure to decrease. However, according to the analysis of Section 9.5, if a phase is such that
            compressing it causes its pressure to decrease (i.e., if its isothermal compressibility is negative)
            then the phase is unstable to density fluctuations. Thus, below the critical temperature, the stable
            states on a given isotherm are divided into two groups. The first group is characterized by relatively
            small molar volumes—these are liquid states. The second group is characterized by relatively large
            molar volumes—these are gas states. The liquid and gas states are separated by a set of unstable
            states. Above the critical temperature, the distinct liquid and gas states cease to exist—there is
            only a single stable fluid state. Consider the region of the v
            -p plane in which the states predicted
            by Equation (9.82) are unstable. It turns out that our analysis has broken down here because we
            assumed the existence of a single phase, whereas, in fact, in this region of the v
            -p plane, there
            exists a stable mixture of liquid and gas phases in equilibrium with one another. Let us investigate
            further.
            At a given temperature and pressure, the true equilibrium state of a system is that which minimizes the Gibbs free energy. (See Section 9.4.) For the case of a van der Waals fluid,

            T = 0.9. The corresponding isotherm is shown on the right. States in the range 2-3-4-5-6 are
            unstable.

            Figure 9.4 shows g plotted as a function of p for T = 0.9. Also shown is the corresponding
            isotherm in the v
            -p plane. Although the van der Waals equation of state associates some pressures
            with more than one molar volume, the thermodynamically stable state is that with the lowest Gibbs
            free energy. Thus, the triangular loop in the graph of g versus p (points 2-3-4-5-6) corresponds
            to unstable states. As the pressure is gradually increased, the system will go straight from point 2
            to point 6, with an abrupt reduction in molar volume. Of course, this corresponds to a gas-liquid
            phase transition. At intermediate molar volumes, the thermodynamically stable state is a mixture
            of gaseous and liquid phases at the transition pressure, as illustrated by the straight-line in the v
            -p
            graph. The curved portion of the isotherm that is cut off by this straight-line correctly indicates
            what the allowed states would be if the fluid were homogeneous. However, these homogeneous
            states are unstable, because there is always another mixed state at the same pressure that possesses
            a lower Gibbs free energy.
            The pressure at the phase transition can easily be determined from the graph of g versus p
            .
            However, it is also possible to determine this pressure directly from the v
            -p isotherm. Note that
            the net change in G in going around the triangular loop 2-3-4-5-6 in Figure 9.4 is zero. Hence,

            In other words, the straight-line in the right-hand panel of Figure 9.4 must be drawn in such a
            manner that the area enclosed between it and the curve 6-5-4 is equal to that enclosed between it
            and the curve 4-3-2. Drawing the straight-line so as to enclose equal areas in this manner is known
            as the Maxwell construction, after James Clerk Maxwell.
            Repeating the Maxwell construction for a variety of temperatures yields the phase diagram
            shown in Figure 9.5. [See J. Lekner, Am. J. Phys. 50, 161 (1982) for a practical method of implementing the Maxwell construction analytically. See, also, Exercise 9.7.] For each temperature,
            there is a well-defined pressure, known as the vapor pressure, at which the liquid-gas transformation takes place. Plotting this pressure versus the temperature yields the phase diagram shown in
            Figure 9.6. Note that the liquid-gas phase boundary disappears at the critical temperature (T = Tc),
            because there is no phase transformation above this temperature. The point at which the phase
            boundary disappears is called the critical point. The corresponding temperature, pressure, and
            volume are known as the critical temperature, pressure, and volume, respectively. At the critical
            point, the properties of the liquid and gas phases become identical.
            Consider a phase transformation at some temperature T < Tc in which the gaseous phase has
            the molar volume vg, whereas the liquid phase has the molar volume vl < vg. Now, the molar

            ) is an unimportant function of the reduced temperature. (See Exercise 8.9.) Thus, the

            Figure 9.7 shows the latent heat of vaporization of a van der Waals fluid plotted as a function
            of the temperature. It can be seen that the latent heat drops abruptly to zero as the temperature
            exceeds the critical temperature. Note the great similarity between this figure and Figure 7.10,
            which illustrates the variation of the spontaneous magnetization of a ferromagnet with temperature,
            according to mean-field theory. This similarity is not surprising, because it turns out that the
            simplifying assumptions that were made during the derivation of the van der Waals equation of
            state in Section 8.11 amount to a form of mean-field theory.

            Classical Mechanics 253
            B Classical Mechanics
            B.1 Generalized Coordinates
            Let the qi, for i = 1, F , be a set of coordinates that uniquely specifies the instantaneous configuration of some classical dynamical system. Here, it is assumed that each of the qi can vary
            independently. The qi might be Cartesian coordinates, or polar coordinates, or angles, or some
            mixture of all three types of coordinate, and are, therefore, termed generalized coordinates. A dynamical system whose instantaneous configuration is fully specified by F independent generalized
            coordinates is said to have F degrees of freedom. For instance, the instantaneous position of a particle moving freely in three dimensions is completely specified by its three Cartesian coordinates,
            x, y, and z. Moreover, these coordinates are clearly independent of one another. Hence, a dynamical system consisting of a single particle moving freely in three dimensions has three degrees of
            freedom. If there are two freely moving particles then the system has six degrees of freedom, and
            so on.
            Suppose that we have a dynamical system consisting of N particles moving freely in three
            dimensions. This is an F = 3N degree of freedom system whose instantaneous configuration can
            be specified by F Cartesian coordinates. Let us denote these coordinates the xj, for j = 1, F . Thus,
            x1, x2, x3 are the Cartesian coordinates of the first particle, x4, x5, x6 the Cartesian coordinates of
            the second particle, et cetera. Suppose that the instantaneous configuration of the system can also
            be specified by F generalized coordinates, which we shall denote the qi, for i = 1, F . Thus, the qi
            might be the spherical coordinates of the particles. In general, we expect the xj to be functions of
            the qi. In other words,
            xj = xj(q1, q2, ··· , qF , t), (B.1)
            for j = 1, F . Here, for the sake of generality, we have included the possibility that the functional
            relationship between the xj and the qi might depend on the time, t, explicitly. This would be the
            case if the dynamical system were subject to time-varying constraints. For instance, a system
            consisting of a particle constrained to move on a surface that is itself moving. Finally, by the chain
            rule, the variation of the xj caused by a variation of the qi (at constant t) is given by
            δxj =
            
            i=1,F
            ∂xj
            ∂qi
            δqi, (B.2)
            for j = 1, F .
            B.2 Generalized Forces
            The work done on the dynamical system when its Cartesian coordinates change by δxj is simply
            δW =
            
            j=1,F
            fj δxj (B.3)
            254 B.3. Lagrange’s Equation
            Here, the fj are the Cartesian components of the forces acting on the various particles making up
            the system. Thus, f1, f2, f3 are the components of the force acting on the first particle, f4, f5, f6 the
            components of the force acting on the second particle, et cetera. Using Equation (B.2), we can also
            write
            δW =
            
            j=1,F
            fj
            
            i=1,F
            ∂xj
            ∂qi
            δqi. (B.4)
            The previous expression can be rearranged to give
            δW =
            
            i=1,F
            Qi δqi, (B.5)
            where
            Qi =
            
            j=1,F
            fj
            ∂xj
            ∂qi
            . (B.6)
            Here, the Qi are termed generalized forces. More explicitly, Qi is termed the force conjugate
            to the coordinate qi. Note that a generalized force does not necessarily have the dimensions of
            force. However, the product Qi qi must have the dimensions of work. Thus, if a particular qi is a
            Cartesian coordinate then the associated Qi is a force. Conversely, if a particular qi is an angle then
            the associated Qi is a torque.
            Suppose that the dynamical system in question is energy conserving. It follows that
            fj = −∂U
            ∂xj
            , (B.7)
            for j = 1, F , where U(x1, x2, ··· , xF , t) is the system’s potential energy. Hence, according to
            Equation (B.6),
            Qi = −
            
            j=1,F

            ∂qi
            = −∂U
            ∂qi
            , (B.8)
            for i = 1, F .
            B.3 Lagrange’s Equation
            The Cartesian equations of motion of our dynamical system take the form
            mj x¨j = fj, (B.9)
            for j = 1, F , where m1, m2, m3 are each equal to the mass of the first particle, m4, m5, m6 are each
            equal to the mass of the second particle, et cetera. Furthermore, the kinetic energy of the system
            can be written
            K = 1

            Classical Mechanics 255
            Now, because xj = xj(q1, q2, ··· , qF , t), we can write
            x˙j =
            
            i=1,F
            ∂xj

            ∂xj
            ∂t
            , (B.11)
            for j = 1, F . Hence, it follows that ˙xj = x˙j( ˙q1, q˙2, ··· , q˙F , q1, q2, ··· , qF , t). According to the
            previous equation,
            ∂x˙j
            ∂q˙i
            = ∂xj
            ∂qi
            , (B.12)
            where we are treating the ˙qi and the qi as independent variables.
            Multiplying Equation (B.12) by ˙xj, and then differentiating with respect to time, we obtain

            It is helpful to introduce a function L, called the Lagrangian, which is defined as the difference
            between the kinetic and potential energies of the dynamical system under investigation:
            L = K − U. (B.21)
            Because the potential energy, U, is clearly independent of the ˙qi, it follows from Equation (B.20)
            that
            d
            dt
            ∂L

            − ∂L
            ∂qi
            = 0, (B.22)
            for i = 1, F . This equation is known as Lagrange’s equation.
            According to the previous analysis, if we can express the kinetic and potential energies of our
            dynamical system solely in terms of our generalized coordinates, and their time derivatives, then
            we can immediately write down the equations of motion of the system, expressed in terms of
            the generalized coordinates, using Lagrange’s equation, (B.22). Unfortunately, this scheme only
            works for energy-conserving systems.
            B.4 Generalized Momenta
            Consider the motion of a single particle moving in one dimension. The kinetic energy is
            K = 1
            2 m x˙ 2
            , (B.23)
            where m is the mass of the particle, and x its displacement. The particle’s linear momentum is
            p = m x˙. However, this can also be written
            p = ∂K
            ∂x˙ = ∂L
            ∂x˙
            , (B.24)
            because L = K − U, and the potential energy, U, is independent of ˙x.
            Consider a dynamical system described by F generalized coordinates, qi, for i = 1, F . By
            analogy with the previous expression, we can define generalized momenta of the form
            pi = ∂L
            ∂q˙i
            , (B.25)
            for i = 1, F . Here, pi is sometimes called the momentum conjugate to the coordinate qi. Hence,
            Lagrange’s equation, (B.22), can be written
            d pi
            dt = ∂L
            ∂qi
            , (B.26)
            Classical Mechanics 257
            for i = 1, F . Note that a generalized momentum does not necessarily have the dimensions of linear
            momentum.
            Suppose that the Lagrangian, L, does not depend explicitly on some coordinate qk. It follows
            from Equation (B.26) that
            d pk
            dt = ∂L
            ∂qk
            = 0. (B.27)
            Hence,
            pk = constant. (B.28)
            The coordinate qk is said to be ignorable in this case. Thus, we conclude that the generalized
            momentum associated with an ignorable coordinate is a constant of the motion.
            B.5 Calculus of Variations
            It is a well-known fact, first enunciated by Archimedes, that the shortest distance between two
            points in a plane is a straight-line. However, suppose that we wish to demonstrate this result from
            first principles. Let us consider the length, l, of various curves, y(x), that run between two fixed
            points, A and B, in a plane. Now, l takes the form
            l =
             B
            A
            [dx 2 + dy 2
            ]
            1/2 =
             b
            a
            [1 + y 2
            (x)]1/2 dx, (B.29)
            where y ≡ dy/dx. Note that l is a function of the function y(x). In mathematics, a function of a
            function is termed a functional.
            In order to find the shortest path between points A and B, we need to minimize the functional l
            with respect to small variations in the function y(x), subject to the constraint that the end points, A
            and B, remain fixed. In other words, we need to solve
            δl = 0. (B.30)
            The meaning of the previous equation is that if y(x) → y(x) + δy(x), where δy(x) is small, then
            the first-order variation in l, denoted δl, vanishes. In other words, l → l + O(δy 2). The particular
            function y(x) for which δl = 0 obviously yields an extremum of l (i.e., either a maximum or a
            minimum). Hopefully, in the case under consideration, it yields a minimum of l.
            Consider a general functional of the form
            I =
             b
            a
            F(y, y
            , x) dx, (B.31)
            where the end points of the integration are fixed. Suppose that y(x) → y(x) + δy(x). The first-order
            variation in I is written
            δI =
             b
            a
            
            ∂F
            ∂y δy +
            ∂F

            258 B.5. Calculus of Variations
            where δy = d(δy)/dx. Setting δI to zero, we obtain
             b
            a
            
            ∂F
            ∂y δy +
            ∂F
            ∂y δy
            
            dx = 0. (B.33)
            This equation must be satisfied for all possible small perturbations, δy(x).
            Integrating the second term in the integrand of the previous equation by parts, we get
             b
            a
            
            ∂F

            ∂y δyb
            a
            = 0. (B.34)
            If the end points are fixed then δy = 0 at x = a and x = b. Hence, the last term on the left-hand
            side of the previous equation is zero. Thus, we obtain
             b
            a
            
            ∂F

            ∂F
            ∂y
             δy dx = 0. (B.35)
            The previous equation must be satisfied for all small perturbations δy(x). The only way in which
            this is possible is for the expression enclosed in square brackets in the integral to be zero. Hence,
            the functional I attains an extremum value whenever
            d
            dx
            ∂F
            ∂y
            
            − ∂F
            ∂y = 0. (B.36)
            This condition is known as the Euler-Lagrange equation.
            Let us consider some special cases. Suppose that F does not explicitly depend on y. It follows
            that ∂F/∂y = 0. Hence, the Euler-Lagrange equation, (B.36), simplifies to
            ∂F
            ∂y = constant. (B.37)
            Next, suppose that F does not depend explicitly on x. Multiplying Equation (B.36) by y
            , we obtain
            y d
            dx
            ∂F
            ∂y
            
            − y ∂F
            ∂y = 0. (B.38)
            However,

            y ∂F

            ∂y
            . (B.39)
            Thus, we get

            dx
            y ∂F
            ∂y

            + y ∂F
            ∂y
            . (B.40)
            If F is not an explicit function of x then the right-hand side of the previous equation is the total
            derivative of F, namely dF/dx. Hence, we obtain
            d
            dx
            y ∂F
            ∂y

            dx , (B.41)
            Classical Mechanics 259
            which yields
            y ∂F
            ∂y − F = constant. (B.42)
            Returning to the case under consideration, we have F = (1 + y 2)
            1/2, according to Equations (B.29) and (B.31). Hence, F is not an explicit function of y, so Equation (B.37) yields
            ∂F
            ∂y = y
            
            1 + y 2 = c, (B.43)
            where c is a constant. So,
            y = c
            √
            1 − c 2 = constant. (B.44)
            Of course, y = constant is the equation of a straight-line. Thus, the shortest distance between two
            fixed points in a plane is indeed a straight-line.
            B.6 Conditional Variation
            Suppose that we wish to find the function, y(x), that maximizes or minimizes the functional
            I =
             b
            a
            F(y, y
            , x) dx, (B.45)
            subject to the constraint that the value of
            J =
             b
            a
            G(y, y
            , x) dx (B.46)
            remains constant. We can achieve our goal by finding an extremum of the new functional K =
            I + λ J, where λ(x) is an undetermined function. We know that δJ = 0, because the value of J is
            fixed, so if δK = 0 then δI = 0 as well. In other words, finding an extremum of K is equivalent to
            finding an extremum of I. Application of the Euler-Lagrange equation yields
            d
            dx
            ∂F
            ∂y

            − ∂[λ G]
            ∂y 
            = 0. (B.47)
            In principle, the previous equation, together with the constraint (B.46), yields the functions λ(x)
            and y(x). Incidentally, λ is generally termed a Lagrange multiplier. If F and G have no explicit
            x-dependence then λ is usually a constant.
            As an example, consider the following famous problem. Suppose that a uniform chain of fixed
            length l is suspended by its ends from two equal-height fixed points that are a distance a apart,
            where a < l. What is the equilibrium configuration of the chain?
            Suppose that the chain has the uniform density per unit length ρ. Let the x- and y-axes be
            horizontal and vertical, respectively, and let the two ends of the chain lie at (±a/2, 0). The equilibrium configuration of the chain is specified by the function y(x), for −a/2 ≤ x ≤ +a/2, where
            260 B.6. Conditional Variation
            y(x) is the vertical distance of the chain below its end points at horizontal position x. Of course,
            y(−a/2) = y(+a/2) = 0.
            The stable equilibrium state of a conservative dynamical system is one that minimizes the
            system’s potential energy. The potential energy of the chain is written
            U = −ρ g 
            y ds = −ρ g  a/2
            −a/2
            y [1 + y 2
            ]
            1/2 dx, (B.48)
            where ds = [dx 2 + dy 2]
            1/2 is an element of length along the chain, and g the acceleration due to
            gravity. Hence, we need to minimize U with respect to small variations in y(x). However, the variations in y(x) must be such as to conserve the fixed length of the chain. Hence, our minimization
            procedure is subject to the constraint that
            l =
            
            ds =
             a/2
            −a/2
            [1 + y 2
            ]
            1/2 dx (B.49)
            remains constant.
            It follows, from the previous discussion, that we need to minimize the functional
            K = U + λ l =
             a/2
            −a/2
            (−ρgy + λ) [1 + y 2
            ]
            1/2 dx, (B.50)
            where λ is an, as yet, undetermined constant. Because the integrand in the functional does not
            depend explicitly on x, we have from Equation (B.42) that
            y 2 (−ρgy + λ) [1 + y 2
            ]
            −1/2 − (−ρgy + λ) [1 + y 2
            ]
            1/2 = k, (B.51)
            where k is a constant. This expression reduces to
            y 2 =
            
            
            λ + y

            − 1, (B.52)
            where λ = λ/k, and h = −k/ρ g.
            Let
            λ + y
            h = − cosh z. (B.53)
            Making this substitution, Equation (B.52) yields
            dz
            dx = −h−1
            . (B.54)
            Hence,
            z = −x
            h + c, (B.55)
            where c is a constant. It follows from Equation (B.53) that
            y(x) = −h
            &
            λ + cosh

            + c
            '. (B.56)
            Classical Mechanics 261
            The previous solution contains three undetermined constants, h, λ
            , and c. We can eliminate two
            of these constants by application of the boundary conditions y(±a/2) = 0. This yields

            = 0. (B.57)
            Hence, c = 0, and λ = − cosh(a/2 h). It follows that
            y(x) = h
            &
            cosh 
             a

             x
            h
            '. (B.58)
            The final unknown constant, h, is determined via the application of the constraint (B.49). Thus,
            l =
             a/2
            −a/2

            Hence, the equilibrium configuration of the chain is given by the curve (B.58), which is known as

            for i = 1, F , which determine the F functions yi(x). If F does not explicitly depend on the function
            yk then the kth Euler-Lagrange equation simplifies to
            ∂F

            k
            = constant. (B.63)
            Likewise, if F does not explicitly depend on x then all F Euler-Lagrange equations simplify to

            262 B.8. Hamilton’s Principle
            B.8 Hamilton’s Principle
            We can specify the instantaneous configuration of a conservative dynamical system with F degrees of freedom in terms of F independent generalized coordinates, qi, for i = 1, F . Let
            K(q1, q2, ··· , qF , q˙1, q˙2, ··· , q˙F , t) and U(q1, q2, ··· , qF , t) represent the kinetic and potential energies of the system, respectively, expressed in terms of these generalized coordinates. The Lagrangian of the system is defined
            L(q1, q2, ··· , qF , q˙1, q˙2, ··· , q˙F , t) = K − U. (B.65)
            Finally, the F Lagrangian equations of motion of the system take the form
            d
            dt
            ∂L
            ∂q˙i
            
            − ∂L
            ∂qi
            = 0, (B.66)
            for i = 1, F .
            Note that the previous equations of motion have exactly the same mathematical form as the
            Euler-Lagrange equations, (B.62). Indeed, it is clear that the F Lagrangian equations of motion,
            (B.66), can all be derived from a single equation: namely,
            δ
             t2
            t1
            L(q1, q2, ··· , qF , q˙1, q˙2, ··· , q˙F , t) dt = 0. (B.67)
            In other words, the motion of the system in a given time interval is such as to maximize or minimize
            the time integral of the Lagrangian, which is known as the action integral. Thus, the laws of
            Newtonian dynamics can be summarized in a single statement:
            The motion of a dynamical system in a given time interval is such as to maximize or
            minimize the action integral.
            (In practice, the action integral is almost always minimized.) This statement is known as Hamilton’s principle, and was first formulated in 1834 by the Irish mathematician William Hamilton.
            B.9 Hamilton’s Equations
            Consider a dynamical system with F degrees of freedom that is described by the generalized
            coordinates qi, for i = 1, F . Suppose that neither the kinetic energy, K, nor the potential energy,
            U, depend explicitly on the time, t. In conventional dynamical systems, the potential energy is
            generally independent of the ˙qi, whereas the kinetic energy takes the form of a homogeneous
            quadratic function of the ˙qi. In other words,
            K =
            
            i, j=1,F
            mi j q˙i q˙j, (B.68)
            Classical Mechanics 263
            where the mi j depend on the qi, but not on the ˙qi. It is easily demonstrated from the previous
            equation that
            
            i=1,F
            q˙i
            ∂K
            ∂q˙i
            = 2 K. (B.69)
            Recall, from Section B.4, that generalized momentum conjugate to the ith generalized coordinate is defined
            pi = ∂L
            ∂q˙i
            = ∂K
            ∂q˙i
            , (B.70)
            where L = K − U is the Lagrangian of the system, and we have made use of the fact that U is
            independent of the ˙qi. Consider the function
            H =
            
            i=1,F
            q˙i pi − L =
            
            i=1,F
            q˙i pi − K + U. (B.71)
            If all of the conditions discussed previously are satisfied then Equations (B.69) and (B.70) yield
            H = K + U. (B.72)
            In other words, the function H is equal to the total energy of the system.
            Consider the variation of the function H. We have
            δH =
            
            i=1,F
            
            δq˙i pi + q˙i δpi − ∂L
            ∂q˙i
            δq˙i − ∂L
            ∂qi
            δqi
            
            . (B.73)
            The first and third terms in the bracket cancel, because pi = ∂L/∂q˙i. Furthermore, because Lagrange’s equation can be written ˙pi = ∂L/∂qi (see Section B.4), we obtain
            δH =
            
            i=1,F
            (q˙i δpi − p˙i δqi) . (B.74)
            Suppose, now, that we can express the total energy of the system, H, solely as a function of the
            qi and the pi, with no explicit dependence on the ˙qi. In other words, suppose that we can write
            H = H(qi, pi). When the energy is written in this fashion it is generally termed the Hamiltonian of
            the system. The variation of the Hamiltonian function takes the form
            δH =
            
            i=1,F
            
            ∂H
            ∂pi
            δpi +
            ∂H
            ∂qi
            δqi
            
            . (B.75)
            A comparison of the previous two equations yields
            q˙i = ∂H
            ∂pi
            , (B.76)
            p˙i = −∂H
            ∂qi
            , (B.77)
            for i = 1, F . These 2F first-order differential equations are known as Hamilton’s equations.
            Hamilton’s equations are often a useful alternative to Lagrange’s equations, which take the form
            of F second-order differential equations.

            Wave Mechanics 265
            C Wave Mechanics
            C.1 Introduction
            According to classical physics (i.e., physics prior to the 20th century), particles and waves are
            distinct classes of physical entity that possess markedly different properties. For instance, particles
            are discrete, which means that they cannot be arbitrarily divided. In other words, it makes sense
            to talk about one electron, or two electrons, but not about a third of an electron. Waves, on the
            other hand, are continuous, which means that they can be arbitrarily divided. In other words, given
            a wave whose amplitude has a certain value, it makes sense to talk about a similar wave whose
            amplitude is one third, or any other fraction whatsoever, of this value. Particles are also highly
            localized in space. For example, atomic nuclei have very small radii of order 10−15 m, whereas
            electrons act like point particles (i.e., they have no discernible spatial extent). Waves, on the other
            hand, are non-localized in space. In fact, a wave is defined as a disturbance that is periodic in
            space, with some finite periodicity length (i.e., wavelength). Hence, it is fairly meaningless to talk
            about a disturbance being a wave unless it extends over a region of space that is at least a few
            wavelengths in size.
            The classical scenario, just described, in which particles and waves are distinct phenomena,
            had to be significantly modified in the early decades of the 20th century. During this time period, physicists discovered, much to their surprise, that, under certain circumstances, waves act
            as particles, and particles act as waves. This bizarre behavior is known as wave-particle duality.
            For instance, the photoelectric effect (see Section C.2) shows that electromagnetic waves sometimes act like swarms of massless particles called photons. Moreover, the phenomenon of electron
            diffraction by atomic lattices (see Section C.3) implies that electrons sometimes possess wave-like
            properties. Wave-particle duality usually only manifests itself on atomic and sub-atomic lengthscales [i.e., on lengthscales less than, or of order, 10−10 m. (See Section C.3).] The classical picture
            remains valid on significantly longer lengthscales. Thus, on macroscopic lengthscales, waves only
            act like waves, particles only act like particles, and there is no wave-particle duality. However,
            on atomic lengthscales, classical mechanics, which governs the macroscopic behavior of massive
            particles, and classical electrodynamics, which governs the macroscopic behavior of electromagnetic fields—neither of which take wave-particle duality into account—must be replaced by new
            theories. The theories in question are called quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics,
            respectively. In this appendix, we shall discuss a simple version of quantum mechanics in which
            the microscopic dynamics of massive particles (i.e., particles with finite mass) is described entirely in terms of wavefunctions. This particular version of quantum mechanics is known as wave
            mechanics.
            266 C.2. Photoelectric Effect
            C.2 Photoelectric Effect
            The so-called photoelectric effect, by which a polished metal surface emits electrons when illuminated by visible or ultra-violet light, was discovered by Heinrich Hertz in 1887. The following facts
            regarding this effect can be established via careful observation. First, a given surface only emits
            electrons when the frequency of the light with which it is illuminated exceeds a certain threshold
            value that is a property of the metal. Second, the current of photoelectrons, when it exists, is proportional to the intensity of the light falling on the surface. Third, the energy of the photoelectrons
            is independent of the light intensity, but varies linearly with the light frequency. These facts are
            inexplicable within the framework of classical physics.
            In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed a radical new theory of light in order to account for the
            photoelectric effect. According to this theory, light of fixed angular frequency ω consists of a
            collection of indivisible discrete packages, called quanta,
            1 whose energy is
            E = ω. (C.1)
            Here,  = 1.055 × 10−34 J s is a new constant of nature, known as Planck’s constant. (Strictly
            speaking, it is Planck’s constant divided by 2π). Incidentally,  is called Planck’s constant, rather
            than Einstein’s constant, because Max Planck first introduced the concept of the quantization of
            light, in 1900, when trying to account for the electromagnetic spectrum of a black body (i.e., a
            perfect emitter and absorber of electromagnetic radiation).
            Suppose that the electrons at the surface of a piece of metal lie in a potential well of depth
            W. In other words, the electrons have to acquire an energy W in order to be emitted from the
            surface. Here, W is generally called the workfunction of the surface, and is a property of the metal.
            Suppose that an electron absorbs a single quantum of light, otherwise known as a photon. Its
            energy therefore increases by ω. If ω is greater than W then the electron is emitted from the
            surface with the residual kinetic energy
            K = ω − W. (C.2)
            Otherwise, the electron remains trapped in the potential well, and is not emitted. Here, we are
            assuming that the probability of an electron absorbing two or more photons is negligibly small
            compared to the probability of it absorbing a single photon (as is, indeed, the case for relatively
            low-intensity illumination). Incidentally, we can determine Planck’s constant, as well as the workfunction of the metal, by plotting the kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons as a function
            of the wave frequency. This plot is a straight-line whose slope is , and whose intercept with the
            ω axis is W/. Finally, the number of emitted electrons increases with the intensity of the light
            because, the more intense the light, the larger the flux of photons onto the surface. Thus, Einstein’s
            quantum theory of light is capable of accounting for all three of the previously mentioned observational facts regarding the photoelectric effect. In the following, we shall assume that the central
            component of Einstein’s theory—namely, Equation (C.1)—is a general result that applies to all
            particles, not just photons.

            Wave Mechanics 267
            C.3 Electron Diffraction
            In 1927, George Paget Thomson discovered that if a beam of electrons is made to pass through a
            thin metal film then the regular atomic array in the metal acts as a sort of diffraction grating, so
            that when a photographic film, placed behind the metal, is developed, an interference pattern is discernible. This implies that electrons have wave-like properties. Moreover, the electron wavelength,
            λ, or, alternatively, the wavenumber, k = 2π/λ, can be deduced from the spacing of the maxima
            in the interference pattern. Thomson found that the momentum, p, of an electron is related to its
            wavenumber, k, according to the following simple relation:
            p =  k. (C.3)
            The associated wavelength, λ = 2π/k, is known as the de Broglie wavelength, because this relation was first hypothesized by Louis de Broglie in 1926. In the following, we shall assume that
            Equation (C.3) is a general result that applies to all particles, not just electrons.
            It turns out that wave-particle duality only manifests itself on lengthscales less than, or of
            order, the de Broglie wavelength. Under normal circumstances, this wavelength is fairly small.
            For instance, the de Broglie wavelength of an electron is
            λe = 1.2 × 10−9 [E(eV)]−1/2 m, (C.4)
            where the electron energy is conveniently measured in units of electron-volts (eV). (An electron
            accelerated from rest through a potential difference of 1000 V acquires an energy of 1000 eV, and
            so on. Electrons in atoms typically have energies in the range 10 to 100 eV.) Moreover, the de
            Broglie wavelength of a proton is
            λp = 2.9 × 10−11 [E(eV)]−1/2 m. (C.5)
            C.4 Representation of Waves via Complex Numbers
            In mathematics, the symbol i is conventionally used to represent the square-root of minus one: that
            is, the solution of i 2 = −1. A real number, x (say), can take any value in a continuum of values lying
            between −∞ and +∞. On the other hand, an imaginary number takes the general form i y, where y
            is a real number. It follows that the square of a real number is a positive real number, whereas the
            square of an imaginary number is a negative real number. In addition, a general complex number
            is written
            z = x + i y, (C.6)
            where x and y are real numbers. In fact, x is termed the real part of z, and y the imaginary part of
            z. This is written mathematically as x = Re(z) and y = Im(z). Finally, the complex conjugate of z
            is defined z∗ = x − i y.
            Just as we can visualize a real number as a point on an infinite straight-line, we can visualize
            a complex number as a point in an infinite plane. The coordinates of the point in question are
            the real and imaginary parts of the number: that is, z ≡ (x, y). The distance, r = (x 2 + y 2)
            1/2,
            268 C.4. Representation of Waves via Complex Numbers
            of the representative point from the origin is termed the modulus of the corresponding complex
            number, z. This is written mathematically as |z| = (x 2 + y 2)
            1/2. Incidentally, it follows that z z∗ =
            x 2+y 2 = |z|
            2. The angle, θ = tan−1(y/x), that the straight-line joining the representative point to the
            origin subtends with the real axis is termed the argument of the corresponding complex number, z.
            This is written mathematically as arg(z) = tan−1
            (y/x). It follows from standard trigonometry that
            x = r cos θ, and y = r sin θ. Hence, z = r cos θ + irsin θ.
            Complex numbers are often used to represent waves and wavefunctions. All such representations ultimately depend on a fundamental mathematical identity, known as Euler’s theorem, which
            takes the form
            ei φ ≡ cos φ + i sin φ, (C.7)
            where φ is a real number. Incidentally, given that z = r cos θ + ir sin θ = r(cos θ + i sin θ), where
            z is a general complex number, r = |z| its modulus, and θ = arg(z) its argument, it follows from
            Euler’s theorem that any complex number, z, can be written
            z = r ei θ
            , (C.8)
            where r = |z| and θ = arg(z) are real numbers.
            A one-dimensional wavefunction takes the general form
            ψ(x, t) = A cos(ωt − k x − φ), (C.9)
            where A > 0 is the wave amplitude, φ the phase angle, k the wavenumber, and ω the angular
            frequency. Consider the complex wavefunction
            ψ(x, t) = ψ0 e−i (ωt−k x)
            , (C.10)
            where ψ0 is a complex constant. We can write
            ψ0 = A ei φ, (C.11)
            where A is the modulus, and φ the argument, of ψ0. Hence, we deduce that
            Re
            ψ0 e−i (ωt−k x)
            
            = Re
            A ei φ e−i (ωt−k x)
            
            = Re
            A e−i (ωt−k x−φ)
            
            = A Re
            e−i (ωt−k x−φ)
            
            . (C.12)
            Thus, it follows from Euler’s theorem, and Equation (C.9), that
            Re
            ψ0 e−i (ωt−k x)
            
            = A cos(ωt − k x − φ) = ψ(x, t). (C.13)
            In other words, a general one-dimensional real wavefunction, (C.9), can be represented as the real
            part of a complex wavefunction of the form (C.10). For ease of notation, the “take the real part”
            aspect of the previous expression is usually omitted, and our general one-dimension wavefunction
            is simply written
            ψ(x, t) = ψ0 e−i (ωt−k x)
            . (C.14)
            The main advantage of the complex representation, (C.14), over the more straightforward real
            representation, (C.9), is that the former enables us to combine the amplitude, A, and the phase
            angle, φ, of the wavefunction into a single complex amplitude, ψ0.
            Wave Mechanics 269
            C.5 Schrodinger’s Equation ¨
            The basic premise of wave mechanics is that a massive particle of energy E and linear momentum
            p, moving in the x-direction (say), can be represented by a one-dimensional complex wavefunction
            of the form
            ψ(x, t) = ψ0 e−i (ωt−k x)
            , (C.15)
            where the complex amplitude, ψ0, is arbitrary, while the wavenumber, k, and the angular frequency,
            ω, are related to the particle momentum, p, and energy, E, via the fundamental relations (C.3)
            and (C.1), respectively. The previous one-dimensional wavefunction is the solution of a onedimensional wave equation that determines how the wavefunction evolves in time. As described in
            the following, we can guess the form of this wave equation by drawing an analogy with classical
            physics.
            A classical particle of mass m, moving in a one-dimensional potential U(x), satisfies the energy
            conservation equation
            E = K + U, (C.16)
            where
            K = p2
            2 m
            (C.17)
            is the particle’s kinetic energy. Hence,
            E ψ = (K + U) ψ (C.18)
            is a valid, but not obviously useful, wave equation.
            However, it follows from Equations (C.1) and (C.15) that
            ∂ψ
            ∂t = −i ω ψ0 e−i (ωt−k x) = −i
            E
             ψ, (C.19)
            which can be rearranged to give
            E ψ = i  ∂ψ
            ∂t
            . (C.20)
            Likewise, from Equations (C.3) and (C.15),
            ∂ψ
            ∂x = i k ψ0 e−i (k x−ω t) = i
            p
             ψ, (C.21)
            ∂2ψ
            ∂x 2 = −k 2 ψ0 e−i (k x−ω t) = − p2
            2 ψ, (C.22)
            which can be rearranged to give
            K ψ = p2
            2 m
            ψ = − 2
            2 m
            ∂2ψ
            ∂x 2 . (C.23)
            Thus, combining Equations (C.18), (C.20), and (C.23), we obtain
            i  ∂ψ
            ∂t = − 2
            2 m
            ∂2ψ
            ∂x 2 + U(x) ψ. (C.24)
            270 C.6. Probability Interpretation of Wavefunction
            This equation, which is known as Schr¨odinger’s equation—because it was first formulated by
            Erwin Schr¨odinder in 1926—is the fundamental equation of wave mechanics.
            For a massive particle moving in free space (i.e., U = 0), the complex wavefunction (C.15) is
            a solution of Schr¨odinger’s equation, (C.24), provided
            ω = 
            2 m
            k 2
            . (C.25)
            The previous expression can be thought of as the dispersion relation for matter waves in free space.
            The associated phase velocity is
            vp = ω
            k =  k
            2 m = p
            2 m, (C.26)
            where use has been made of Equation (C.3). However, this phase velocity is only half the classical
            velocity, v = p/m, of a massive (non-relativistic) particle.
            Incidentally, Equation (C.21) suggests that
            p ≡ −i  ∂
            ∂x
            (C.27)
            in quantum mechanics, whereas Equation (C.24)suggests that the most general form of Schr¨odinger’s
            equation is
            i  ∂ψ
            ∂t = H ψ, (C.28)
            where
            H(x, p) ≡
            p2
            2 m
            + U(x) = − 2
            2 m
            ∂2
            ∂x 2 + U(x) (C.29)
            is the Hamiltonian of the system. (See Section B.9.)
            C.6 Probability Interpretation of Wavefunction
            After many false starts, physicists in the early 20th century eventually came to the conclusion
            that the only physical interpretation of a particle wavefunction that is consistent with experimental
            observations is probabilistic in nature. To be more exact, if ψ(x, t) is the complex wavefunction
            of a given particle, moving in one dimension along the x-axis, then the probability of finding the
            particle between x and x + dx at time t is
            P(x, t) = |ψ(x, t)|
            2 dx. (C.30)
            We can interpret
            P(t) =
             ∞
            −∞
            |ψ(x, t)|
            2 dx (C.31)
            as the probability of the particle being found anywhere between x = −∞ and x = +∞ at time t.
            This follows, via induction, from the fundamental result in probability theory that the probability
            of the occurrence of one or other of two mutually exclusive events (such as the particle being found
            Wave Mechanics 271
            in two non-overlapping regions) is the sum (or integral) of the probabilities of the individual events.
            (See Section 2.3.) Assuming that the particle exists, it is certain that it will be found somewhere
            between x = −∞ and x = +∞ at time t. Because a certain event has probability 1 (see Section 2.2),
            our probability interpretation of the wavefunction is only tenable provided
             ∞
            −∞
            |ψ(x, t)|
            2 dx = 1 (C.32)
            at all times. A wavefunction that satisfies the previous condition—which is known as the normalization condition—is said to be properly normalized.
            Suppose that we have a wavefunction, ψ(x, t), which is such that it satisfies the normalization
            condition (C.32) at time t = 0. Furthermore, let the wavefunction evolve in time according to
            Schr¨odinger’s equation, (C.24). Our probability interpretation of the wavefunction only makes
            sense if the normalization condition remains satisfied at all subsequent times. This follows because
            if the particle is certain to be found somewhere on the x-axis (which is the interpretation put on
            the normalization condition) at time t = 0 then it is equally certain to be found somewhere on the
            x-axis at a later time (because we are not considering any physical process by which particles can
            be created or destroyed). Thus, it is necessary for us to demonstrate that Schr¨odinger’s equation
            preserves the normalization of the wavefunction.
            Taking Schr¨odinger’s equation, and multiplying it by ψ∗ (the complex conjugate of the wavefunction), we obtain
            i  ∂ψ
            ∂t ψ∗ = − 2
            2 m

            2
            . (C.33)
            The complex conjugate of the previous expression yields
            −i  ∂ψ∗
            ∂t ψ = − 2
            2 m
            ∂2ψ∗
            ∂x 2 ψ + U(x) |ψ|

            . (C.34)
            Here, use has been made of the readily demonstrated results (ψ∗
            )
            ∗ = ψ and i∗ = −i, as well as the
            fact that U(x) is real. Taking the difference between the previous two expressions, we obtain
            i 
            
            ∂ψ
            ∂t ψ∗ + ∂ψ∗

            Integrating in x, we get
            i  d

            −∞

            −∞
            . (C.37)
            Finally, assuming that the wavefunction is localized in space: that is,
            |ψ(x, t)| → 0 as |x|→∞, (C.38)
            272 C.7. Wave Packets
            we obtain
            d
            dt  ∞
            −∞
            |ψ|
            2 dx = 0. (C.39)
            It follows, from the preceding analysis, that if a localized wavefunction is properly normalized
            at t = 0 (i.e., if  ∞
            −∞ |ψ(x, 0)|
            2 dx = 1) then it will remain properly normalized as it evolves in time
            according to Schr¨odinger’s equation. Incidentally, a wavefunction that is not localized cannot be
            properly normalized, because its normalization integral  ∞
            −∞ |ψ|
            2 dx is necessarily infinite. For such
            a wavefunction, |ψ(x, t)|
            2 dx gives the relative, rather than the absolute, probability of finding the
            particle between x and x + dx at time t. In other words, [cf., Equation (C.30)]
            P(x, t) ∝ |ψ(x, t)|
            2 dx. (C.40)
            C.7 Wave Packets
            As we have seen, the wavefunction of a massive particle of momentum p and energy E, moving in
            free space along the x-axis, can be written
            ψ(x, t) = ψ¯ e−i (ωt−k x)
            , (C.41)
            where k = p/, ω = E/, and ψ¯ is a complex constant. Here, ω and k are linked via the matter
            wave dispersion relation, (C.25). Expression (C.41) represents a plane wave that propagates in the
            x-direction with the phase velocity vp = ω/k. However, it follows from Equation (C.26) that this
            phase velocity is only half of the classical velocity of a massive particle.
            According to the discussion in the previous section, the most reasonable physical interpretation
            of the wavefunction is that |ψ(x, t)|
            2 dx is proportional to (assuming that the wavefunction is not
            properly normalized) the probability of finding the particle between x and x+dx at time t. However,
            the modulus squared of the wavefunction (C.41) is |ψ¯|
            2, which is a constant that depends on neither
            x nor t. In other words, the previous wavefunction represents a particle that is equally likely to be
            found anywhere on the x-axis at all times. Hence, the fact that this wavefunction propagates
            at a phase velocity that does not correspond to the classical particle velocity has no observable
            consequences.
            How can we write the wavefunction of a particle that is localized in x? In other words, a particle
            that is more likely to be found at some positions on the x-axis than at others. It turns out that we
            can achieve this goal by forming a linear combination of plane waves of different wavenumbers:
            that is,
            ψ(x, t) =
             ∞
            −∞
            ψ¯(k) e−i (ωt−k x) dk. (C.42)
            Here, ψ¯(k) represents the complex amplitude of plane waves of wavenumber k within this combination. In writing the previous expression, we are relying on the assumption that matter waves are
            superposable. In other words, it is possible to add two valid wave solutions to form a third valid
            wave solution. The ultimate justification for this assumption is that matter waves satisfy the linear
            wave equation (C.24).
            Wave Mechanics 273
            There is a fundamental mathematical theorem, known as Fourier’s theorem, which states that
            if
            f(x) =
             ∞
            −∞
            ¯f(k) ei k x dk, (C.43)
            then
            ¯f(k) = 1
            2π
             ∞
            −∞
            f(x) e−i k x dx. (C.44)
            Here, ¯f(k) is known as the Fourier transform of the function f(x). We can use Fourier’s theorem
            to find the k-space function, ψ¯(k), that generates any given x-space wavefunction, ψ(x), at a given
            time.
            For instance, suppose that at t = 0 the wavefunction of our particle takes the form
            ψ(x, 0) ∝ exp 
            i k0 x − (x − x0) 2
            4 (∆x) 2
            
            . (C.45)
            Thus, the initial probability distribution for the particle’s x-coordinate is Gaussian (see Section 2.9):
            |ψ(x, 0)|
            2 ∝ exp 
            −(x − x0) 2
            2 (∆x) 2
            
            . (C.46)
            It follows that a measurement of the particle’s position is most likely to yield the value x0, and very
            unlikely to yield a value which differs from x0 by more than 3 ∆x. Thus, Equation (C.45) is the
            wavefunction of a particle that is initially localized in some region of x-space, centered on x = x0,
            whose width is of order ∆x. This type of wavefunction is known as a wave packet.
            According to Equation (C.42),
            ψ(x, 0) =
             ∞
            −∞
            ψ¯(k) ei k x dk. (C.47)
            Hence, we can employ Fourier’s theorem to invert this expression to give
            ψ¯(k) ∝
             ∞
            −∞
            ψ(x, 0) e−i k x dx. (C.48)
            Making use of Equation (C.45), we obtain
            ψ¯(k) ∝ e−i (k−k0) x0
             ∞
            −∞
            exp 
            −i (k − k0) (x − x0) − (x − x0) 2
            4 (∆x) 2
            
            dx. (C.49)
            Changing the variable of integration to y = (x − x0)/(2 ∆x), the previous expression reduces to
            ψ¯(k) ∝ e−i k x0−β2/4
             ∞
            −∞
            e−(y−y0) 2
            dy, (C.50)
            where β = 2 (k−k0) ∆x and y0 = −i β/2. The integral in the previous equation is now just a number,
            as can easily be seen by making the second change of variable z = y − y0. Hence, we deduce that
            ψ¯(k) ∝ exp 
            −i k x0 − (k − k0) 2
            4 (∆k) 2
            
            , (C.51)
            274 C.7. Wave Packets
            where
            ∆k = 1
            2 ∆x
            . (C.52)
            If |ψ(x, 0)|
            2 dx is proportional to the probability of a measurement of the particle’s position
            yielding a value in the range x to x + dx at time t = 0 then it stands to reason that |ψ¯(k)|
            2 dk is
            proportional to the probability of a measurement of the particle’s wavenumber yielding a value in
            the range k to k + dk. (Recall that p =  k, so a measurement of the particle’s wavenumber, k, is
            equivalent to a measurement of the particle’s momentum, p). According to Equation (C.51),
            |ψ¯(k)|
            2 ∝ exp 
            −(k − k0) 2
            2 (∆k) 2
            
            . (C.53)
            This probability distribution is a Gaussian in k-space. [See Equation (C.46).] Hence, a measurement of k is most likely to yield the value k0, and very unlikely to yield a value that differs from k0
            by more than 3 ∆k.
            We have just seen that a wave packet with a Gaussian probability distribution of characteristic width ∆x in x-space [see Equation (C.46)] is equivalent to a wave packet with a Gaussian
            probability distribution of characteristic width ∆k in k-space [see Equation (C.53)], where
            ∆x ∆k = 1
            2
            . (C.54)
            This illustrates an important property of wave packets. Namely, in order to construct a packet that
            is highly localized in x-space (i.e., with small ∆x) we need to combine plane waves with a very
            wide range of different k-values (i.e., with large ∆k). Conversely, if we only combine plane waves
            whose wavenumbers differ by a small amount (i.e., if ∆k is small) then the resulting wave packet
            is highly extended in x-space (i.e., ∆x is large).
            According to standard wave theory, a wave packet made up of a superposition of plane waves
            that is strongly peaked around some central wavenumber k0 propagates at the group velocity,
            vg = dω(k0)
            dk , (C.55)
            rather than the phase velocity, vp = (ω/k)k0 , assuming that all of the constituent plane waves satisfy
            a dispersion relation of the form ω = ω(k). For the case of matter waves, the dispersion relation is
            (C.25). Thus, the associated group velocity is
            vg =  k0
            m = p
            m, (C.56)
            where p =  k0. This velocity is identical to the classical velocity of a (non-relativistic) massive
            particle. We conclude that the matter wave dispersion relation (C.25) is perfectly consistent with
            classical physics, as long as we recognize that particles must be identified with wave packets
            (which propagate at the group velocity) rather than plane waves (which propagate at the phase
            velocity).
            Wave Mechanics 275
            Standard wave theory also implies that the spatial extent of a wave packet of initial extent (∆x)0
            grows, as the packet evolves in time, like
            ∆x  (∆x)0 +
            d 2ω(k0)
            dk 2
            t
            (∆x)0
            , (C.57)
            where k0 is the packet’s central wavenumber. Thus, it follows from the matter wave dispersion
            relation, (C.25), that the width of a particle wave packet grows in time as
            ∆x  (∆x)0 +
            
            m
            t
            (∆x)0
            . (C.58)
            For example, if an electron wave packet is initially localized in a region of atomic dimensions (i.e.,
            ∆x ∼ 10−10 m) then the width of the packet doubles in about 10−16 s.
            C.8 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle
            According to the analysis contained in the previous section, a particle wave packet that is initially
            localized in x-space, with characteristic width ∆x, is also localized in k-space, with characteristic
            width ∆k = 1/(2 ∆x). However, as time progresses, the width of the wave packet in x-space
            increases [see Equation (C.58)], while that of the packet in k-space stays the same [because ψ¯(k) is
            given by Equation (C.48) at all times]. Hence, in general, we can say that
            ∆x ∆k 
            1
            2
            . (C.59)
            Furthermore, we can interpret ∆x and ∆k as characterizing our uncertainty regarding the values of
            the particle’s position and wavenumber, respectively.
            A measurement of a particle’s wavenumber, k, is equivalent to a measurement of its momentum,
            p, because p =  k. Hence, an uncertainty in k of order ∆k translates to an uncertainty in p of order
            ∆p =  ∆k. It follows, from the previous inequality, that
            ∆x ∆p 
            
            2
            . (C.60)
            This is the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle, first proposed by Werner Heisenberg in 1927.
            According to this principle, it is impossible to simultaneously measure the position and momentum of a particle (exactly). Indeed, a good knowledge of the particle’s position implies a poor
            knowledge of its momentum, and vice versa. The uncertainty principle is a direct consequence of
            representing particles as waves.
            It is apparent, from Equation (C.58), that a particle wave packet of initial spatial extent (∆x)0
            spreads out in such a manner that its spatial extent becomes
            ∆x ∼  t
            m (∆x)0
            (C.61)
            276 C.9. Stationary States
            at large t. It is readily demonstrated that this spreading of the wave packet is a consequence of the
            uncertainty principle. Indeed, because the initial uncertainty in the particle’s position is (∆x)0, it
            follows that the uncertainty in its momentum is of order /(∆x)0. This translates to an uncertainty
            in velocity of ∆v = /[m (∆x)0]. Thus, if we imagine that part of the wave packet propagates at
            v0 + ∆v/2, and another part at v0 − ∆v/2, where v0 is the mean propagation velocity, then it follows
            that the wave packet will spread out as time progresses. Indeed, at large t, we expect the width of
            the wave packet to be
            ∆x ∼ ∆vt ∼  t
            m (∆x)0
            , (C.62)
            which is identical to Equation (C.61). Evidently, the spreading of a particle wave packet, as time
            progresses, should be interpreted as representing an increase in our uncertainty regarding the particle’s position, rather than an increase in the spatial extent of the particle itself.
            C.9 Stationary States
            Consider separable solutions to Schr¨odinger’s equation of the form
            ψ(x, t) = ψ(x) e−i ωt
            . (C.63)
            According to Equation (C.20), such solutions have definite energies, E = ω. For this reason, they
            are usually written
            ψ(x, t) = ψ(x) e−i (E/) t
            . (C.64)
            The probability of finding the particle between x and x + dx at time t is
            P(x, t) = |ψ(x, t)|
            2 dx = |ψ(x)|
            2 dx. (C.65)
            This probability is time independent. For this reason, states whose wavefunctions are of the form
            (C.64) are known as stationary states. Moreover, ψ(x) is called a stationary wavefunction. Substituting (C.64) into Schr¨odinger’s equation, (C.24), we obtain the following differential equation for
            ψ(x):
            − 2
            2 m
            d 2
            ψ
            dx 2 + U(x) ψ = E ψ. (C.66)
            This equation is called the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation. Of course, the most general
            form of this equation is
            H ψ = E ψ, (C.67)
            where H is the Hamiltonian. (See Section C.5.)
            Consider a particle trapped in a one-dimensional square potential well, of infinite depth, which
            is such that
            U(x) =
            # 0 0 ≤ x ≤ a
            ∞ otherwise . (C.68)
            Wave Mechanics 277
            The particle is excluded from the region x < 0 or x > a, so ψ = 0 in this region (i.e., there is zero
            probability of finding the particle outside the well). Within the well, a particle of definite energy E
            has a stationary wavefunction, ψ(x), that satisfies
            − 2
            2 m
            d 2ψ
            dx 2 = E ψ. (C.69)
            The boundary conditions are
            ψ(0) = ψ(a) = 0. (C.70)
            This follows because ψ = 0 in the region x < 0 or x > a, and ψ(x) must be continuous [because a
            discontinuous wavefunction would generate a singular term (i.e., the term involving d 2ψ/dx 2) in
            the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation, (C.66), that could not be balanced, even by an infinite
            potential].
            Let us search for solutions to Equation (C.69) of the form
            ψ(x) = ψ0 sin(k x), (C.71)
            where ψ0 is a constant. It follows that
            2 k 2
            2 m = E. (C.72)
            The solution (C.71) automatically satisfies the boundary condition ψ(0) = 0. The second boundary
            condition, ψ(a) = 0, leads to a quantization of the wavenumber: that is,
            k = n
            π
            a
            , (C.73)
            where n = 1, 2, 3, et cetera. (A “quantized” quantity is one that can only take certain discrete
            values.) Here, the integer n is known as a quantum number. According to Equation (C.72), the
            energy is also quantized. In fact, E = En, where
            En = n2 2 π2
            2 m a2 . (C.74)
            Thus, the allowed wavefunctions for a particle trapped in a one-dimensional square potential well
            of infinite depth are
            ψn(x, t) = An sin 
            
            n π
            x
            a
            
            exp 
            
            −i n2 E1
             t
            
            , (C.75)
            where n is a positive integer, and An a constant. We cannot have n = 0, because, in this case, we
            obtain a null wavefunction: that is, ψ = 0, everywhere. Furthermore, if n takes a negative integer
            value then it generates exactly the same wavefunction as the corresponding positive integer value
            (assuming A−n = −An).
            The constant An, appearing in the previous wavefunction, can be determined from the constraint
            that the wavefunction be properly normalized. For the case under consideration, the normalization
            condition (C.32) reduces to
             a
            0
            |ψ(x)|
            2 dx = 1. (C.76)
            278 C.10. Three-Dimensional Wave Mechanics
            It follows from Equation (C.75) that |An|
            2 = 2/a. Hence, the properly normalized version of the
            wavefunction (C.75) is
            ψn(x, t) =
            
            2
            a
            1/2
            sin 
            
            n π
            x
            a
            
            exp 
            
            −i n2 E1
             t
            
            . (C.77)
            At first sight, it seems rather strange that the lowest possible energy for a particle trapped in
            a one-dimensional potential well is not zero, as would be the case in classical mechanics, but
            rather E1 = 2 π2/(2 m a2
            ). In fact, as explained in the following, this residual energy is a direct
            consequence of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. A particle trapped in a one-dimensional well
            of width a is likely to be found anywhere inside the well. Thus, the uncertainty in the particle’s
            position is ∆x ∼ a. It follows from the uncertainty principle, (C.60), that
            ∆p 
            
            2 ∆x ∼ 
            a
            . (C.78)
            In other words, the particle cannot have zero momentum. In fact, the particle’s momentum must be
            at least p ∼ /a. However, for a free particle, E = p2/2 m. Hence, the residual energy associated
            with the particle’s residual momentum is
            E ∼ p2
            m ∼ 2
            m a2 ∼ E1. (C.79)
            This type of residual energy, which often occurs in quantum mechanical systems, and has no
            equivalent in classical mechanics, is called zero point energy.
            C.10 Three-Dimensional Wave Mechanics
            Up to now, we have only discussed wave mechanics for a particle moving in one dimension.
            However, the generalization to a particle moving in three dimensions is fairly straightforward. A
            massive particle moving in three dimensions has a complex wavefunction of the form [cf., Equation (C.15)]
            ψ(x, y,z, t) = ψ0 e−i (ωt−k·r)
            , (C.80)
            where ψ0 is a complex constant, and r = (x, y, z). Here, the wavevector, k, and the angular
            frequency, ω, are related to the particle momentum, p, and energy, E, according to [cf., Equations (C.3) and (C.27)]
            p =  k = −i  ∇, (C.81)
            and [cf., Equation (C.1)]
            E = ω, (C.82)
            respectively. Generalizing the analysis of Section C.5, the three-dimensional version of Schr¨odinger’s
            equation is [cf., Equations (C.24) and (C.29)]
            i  ∂ψ

            where

            2 m
            ∇2 + U(r) (C.84)
            is the Hamiltonian, and the differential operator
            ∇2 ≡
            ∂2
            ∂x 2 +
            ∂2
            ∂y 2 +
            ∂2
            ∂z 2 (C.85)
            is known as the Laplacian. The interpretation of a three-dimensional wavefunction is that the
            probability of simultaneously finding the particle between x and x + dx, between y and y + dy, and
            between z and z + dz, at time t is [cf., Equation (C.30)]
            P(x, y,z, t) = |ψ(x, y,z, t)|
            2 dxdy dz. (C.86)
            Moreover, the normalization condition for the wavefunction becomes [cf., Equation (C.32)]
             ∞
            −∞
             ∞
            −∞
             ∞
            −∞
            |ψ(x, y,z, t)|
            2 dxdy dz = 1. (C.87)
            It can be demonstrated that Schr¨odinger’s equation, (C.83), preserves the normalization condition, (C.87), of a localized wavefunction. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle generalizes to [cf.,
            Equation (C.60)]
            ∆x ∆px 
            
            2

            
            2
            . (C.90)
            Finally, a stationary state of energy E is written [cf., Equation (C.64)]
            ψ(x, y,z, t) = ψ(x, y,z) e−i (E/) t
            , (C.91)
            where the stationary wavefunction, ψ(x, y,z), satisfies [cf., Equation (C.66)]
            H ψ ≡ −
            2
            2 m
            ∇2
            ψ + U(r) ψ = E ψ. (C.92)
            As an example of a three-dimensional problem in wave mechanics, consider a particle trapped
            in a square potential well of infinite depth, such that
            U(x, y,z) =
            # 0 0 ≤ x ≤ a, 0 ≤ y ≤ a, 0 ≤ z ≤ a
            ∞ otherwise . (C.93)
            Within the well, the stationary wavefunction, ψ(x, y,z), satisfies
            − 2
            2 m
            ∇2
            ψ = E ψ, (C.94)
            280 C.10. Three-Dimensional Wave Mechanics
            subject to the boundary conditions
            ψ(0, y,z) = ψ(x, 0,z) = ψ(x, y, 0) = 0, (C.95)
            and
            ψ(a, y,z) = ψ(x, a,z) = ψ(x, y, a) = 0, (C.96)
            because ψ = 0 outside the well. Let us try a separable wavefunction of the form
            ψ(x, y,z) = ψ0 sin(kx x) sin(ky y) sin(kz z). (C.97)
            This expression automatically satisfies the boundary conditions (C.95). The remaining boundary
            conditions, (C.96), are satisfied provided
            kx = nx
            π
            a
            , (C.98)
            ky = ny
            π
            a
            , (C.99)
            kz = nz
            π
            a
            , (C.100)
            where the quantum numbers nx, ny, and nz are (independent) positive integers. Note that a stationary state generally possesses as many quantum numbers as there are degrees of freedom of the
            system (in this case, three). Substitution of the wavefunction (C.97) into Equation (C.94) yields
            E = 2
            2 m
            (k 2
            x + k 2
            y + k 2
            z ). (C.101)
            Thus, it follows from Equations (C.98)–(C.100) that the particle energy is quantized, and that the
            allowed energy levels are
            Enx,ny,nz = 2
            2 m a2 (n2
            x + n2
            y + n2
            z ). (C.102)
            The properly normalized [see Equation (C.87)] stationary wavefunctions corresponding to these
            energy levels are
            ψnx,ny,nz(x, y,z) =
            
            2

            z
            a
            
            . (C.103)
            As is the case for a particle trapped in a one-dimensional potential well, the lowest energy level
            for a particle trapped in a three-dimensional well is not zero, but rather
            E1,1,1 = 3 E1. (C.104)
            Here,
            E1 = 2
            2 m a2 . (C.105)
            Wave Mechanics 281
            is the ground state (i.e., the lowest energy state) energy in the one-dimensional case. It follows
            from Equation (C.102) that distinct permutations of nx, ny, and nz that do not alter the value of
            n2
            x + n2
            y + n2
            z also do not alter the energy. In other words, in three dimensions, it is possible for
            distinct wavefunctions to be associated with the same energy level. In this situation, the energy
            level is said to be degenerate. The ground state energy level, 3 E1, is non-degenerate, because the
            only combination of (nx, ny, nz) that gives this energy is (1, 1, 1). However, the next highest energy
            level, 6 E1, is degenerate, because it is obtained when (nx, ny, ny) take the values (2, 1, 1), or (1,
            2, 1), or (1, 1, 2). In fact, a non-degenerate energy level corresponds to a case where the three
            quantum numbers (i.e., nx, ny, and nz) all have the same value, whereas a three-fold degenerate
            energy level corresponds to a case where only two of the quantum numbers have the same value,
            and, finally, a six-fold degenerate energy level corresponds to a case where the quantum numbers
            are all different.

            The classical Hamiltonian of a simple harmonic oscillator is

            where K > 0 is the so-called force constant of the oscillator. Assuming that the quantummechanical Hamiltonian has the same form as the classical Hamiltonian, the time-independent
            Schr¨odinger equation for a particle of mass m and energy E moving in a simple harmonic potential
            becomes

            Equation (C.107) reduces to

            We need to find solutions to the previous equation that are bounded at infinity. In other words,
            solutions that satisfy the boundary condition ψ → 0 as |y|→∞.
            Consider the behavior of the solution to Equation (C.110) in the limit |y| 
             1. As is easily
            seen, in this limit, the equation simplifies somewhat to give
            d 2ψ

            282 C.11. Simple Harmonic Oscillator
            The approximate solutions to the previous equation are
            ψ(y)  A(y) e ±y 2/2
            , (C.112)
            where A(y) is a relatively slowly-varying function of y. Clearly, if ψ(y) is to remain bounded as
            |y|→∞ then we must chose the exponentially decaying solution. This suggests that we should
            write
            ψ(y) = h(y) e−y 2/2
            , (C.113)
            where we would expect h(y) to be an algebraic, rather than an exponential, function of y.
            Substituting Equation (C.113) into Equation (C.110), we obtain
            d 2
            h

            Let us attempt a power-law solution of the form
            h(y) =

            i=0,∞
            ci yi
            . (C.115)
            Inserting this test solution into Equation (C.114), and equating the coefficients of yi
            , we obtain the
            recursion relation
            ci+2 = (2 i −  + 1)
            (i + 1) (i + 2)
            ci. (C.116)
            Consider the behavior of h(y) in the limit |y|→∞. The previous recursion relation simplifies to
            ci+2  2
            i
            ci. (C.117)
            Hence, at large |y|, when the higher powers of y dominate, we have

            varies as exp 

            
            as |y|→∞. This behavior is unacceptable, because it does not satisfy the boundary condition ψ → 0 as |y|→∞. The only way in
            which we can prevent ψ from blowing up as |y|→∞ is to demand that the power series (C.115)
            terminate at some finite value of i. This implies, from the recursion relation (C.116), that
             = 2 n + 1, (C.119)
            where n is a non-negative integer. Note that the number of terms in the power series (C.115) is
            n + 1. Finally, using Equation (C.109), we obtain
            E = (n + 1/2) ω, (C.120)
            for n = 0, 1, 2, ··· .
            Wave Mechanics 283
            Hence, we conclude that a particle moving in a harmonic potential has quantized energy levels
            that are equally spaced. The spacing between successive energy levels is ω, where ω is the
            classical oscillation frequency. Furthermore, the lowest energy state (n = 0) possesses the finite
            energy (1/2) ω. This is sometimes called zero-point energy. It is easily demonstrated that the
            (normalized) wavefunction of the lowest-energy state takes the form

            C.12 Angular Momentum
            In classical mechanics, the vector angular momentum, L, of a particle of position vector r and
            linear momentum p is defined as
            L = r × p. (C.122)
            In other words,
            Lx = y pz − z py, (C.123)
            Ly = z px − x pz, (C.124)
            Lz = x py − y px. (C.125)
            In quantum mechanics, the operators, pi, that represent the Cartesian components of linear
            momentum, are represented as the spatial differential operators −i  ∂/∂xi. [See Equation (C.81)].
            It follows that:

            In addition, let

            y + L2
            z (C.129)
            be the magnitude-squared of the angular momentum vector.
            It is most convenient to work in terms of the standard spherical coordinates, r, θ, and φ. These
            are defined with respect to our usual Cartesian coordinates as follows:
            x = r sin θ cos φ, (C.130)
            y = r sin θ sin φ, (C.131)
            z = r cos θ. (C.132)

            We, thus, conclude that all of our angular momentum operators can be represented as differential operators involving the angular spherical coordinates, θ and φ, but not involving the radial
            coordinate, r.
            Let us search for an angular wavefunction, Yl,m(θ, φ), that is a simultaneous eigenstate of L2
            and Lz. In other words,
            L2 Yl,m = l(l + 1) 2 Yl,m, (C.140)

            Finally, the constant l is constrained to take non-negative integer values, whereas the constant m
            is constrained to take integer values in the range −l ≤ m ≤ +l. Thus, l is a quantum number
            that determines the value of L2. In fact, L2 = l (l + 1) 2. Likewise, m is a quantum number that
            determines the value of Lz. In fact, Lz = m .
            The classical Hamiltonian of an extended object spinning with constant angular momentum L

            where I is the associated principal moment of inertia. Let us assume that the quantum-mechanical
            Hamiltonian of an object spinning about a principal axis of rotation has the same form. We can
            solve the energy eigenvalue problem,
            H ψ = E ψ, (C.150)
            by writing ψ(r, θ, φ) = R(r) Yl,m(θ, φ), where R(r) is arbitrary. It immediately follows from Equation (C.140) that
            E = l(l + 1) 2

            In other words, the energy levels are quantized in terms of the quantum number, l, that specifies
            the value of L2.

            words, if the object is highly elongated along its symmetry axis) then the spacing between energy
            levels corresponding to different values of m becomes much greater than the spacing between
            energy levels corresponding to different values of l. In this case, it is plausible that the system
